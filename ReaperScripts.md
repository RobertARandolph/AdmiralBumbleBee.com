description: A small selection of awesome scripts made by the Reaper Community
---

There's a plethora of amazing Reaper Scripts out there. Reaper offers [Python and Lua script capabilites](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascript.php) along with a C-based API and its own super-fast [EEL](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php) language.

There's 100s of scripts out there that offer the user an efficiency or quality-of-life boost, but here I aim to showcase the scripts that quickly demonstrate what Reaper's scripting environment is capable of. There's some scripts out there that surpass anything listed, but they require a bit more time to fully appreciate their power.

All of these scripts are cross-platform and work equally well on macOS and Windows. _Most_ of them work on Linux-based operating systems too.

**Note** - These videos are shot at 15fps to save bandwidth. The GUIs very often perform much better live.

# Accessibility

## OSARA accessibility scripts - [Homepage](https://github.com/nvaccess/osara)

**O**pen **S**ource **A**ccessibility for the **R**EAPER **A**pplication.

The world of audio is particularly intriguing for those with limited or no sight. Fortunately OSARA is here to provide a comprehensive set of scripts that make using Reaper with a Screen Reader much easier.

OSARA isn't just for those with impaired sight. It can make the process of operating Reaper while you're not looking at your screen a breez.

Every Reaper user should give OSARA a try, and if you know any sight-impaired musicians then they _need_ to know about it.

Envelope-based compressor is a compressor that applies the amplitude changes to the track's envelope. This allows you to have a compressor that's freely editable on a timeline.

If you've ever struggled trying to get vocal compression _just_ right by fooling with a series of compressors and automation, then Envelope-based compressor is a godsend.

## Envelope based De-Esser - [Thread](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=189120)

Envelope-based DeEsser applies frequency-sensitive compression on the track's envelope. It's just like [Envelope-Based Compressor](#envelope-based-compressor) except the signal is routed through a filter first.

Another amazing script for vocal editing.

Have you ever tried to record a bunch of takes of vocals to create a chorus part, done dialog replacement or tried to layer some lead guitars, but the end result sounds like a total mess?

Maybe you'd have used [Vocalign](http://www.synchroarts.com/products/vocalign-pro/features) in the past, but in Reaper you can freely download and use Align Takes!

Align Takes analyzes nearly an unlimited number of audio items, finds the near-similarities between them then intelligently warps the dub track to the reference track. The result: perfectly timed overdubs.

## AB Level Matching - [Thread](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=140268)

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNlCbcy2GjA?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

When trying to A/B things it's important to manage volume levels so that you're not tricked by the 'louder is better' phenomenon.

This can be difficult to manage with complex sessions, tracks and having to setup various routing for realtime A/B. The A/B Level Matching tool makes it easy and offers a number of advanced options for really getting a hold of your A/B sessions.

{:/nomarkdown}

When using stretch markers naively, the transient is stretched as much as the rest of the sound. For things like percussion it's important that the impact of the sound be retained, and stretch marker guard allows you to do this will still warping your hits in to place.

Stretch marker guard easily allows you to place new stretch markers around the existing markers, either before, after or both. This makes it so that when stretching, the transient is guarded from an extreme stretch. Since stretch markers only affect the area between markers, the transient is given its own small area where minimum stretch occurs, and then the rest of the movement ideally happens during the sustain of the sound.

This is an _exceptionally_ useful tool and can make a huge difference in the impact and fidelity of your drum sounds.

# Midi tools

Articulations are a concept that allows you to trigger specific performance-related attributes in a synth or sampler. They can be very complex to manage, especially for large projects.

Articulation Manager may not make working with articulations easy (nothing can), but it makes it as pain-free as possible.

Have you ever wanted to quantize your stretch markers to midi? Midi to envelope points? Item starts to midi? How about any combination of those _and much more_

You can quantize Items, Stretch Markers, Envelope points and Midi Notes to: Items, Stretch Markers, Envelope points, Notes, Grooves, Grid, and swing grid. All of these with a wide range of options and a %-based-amount to tweak the result to perfection.

Oh yeah, and it all happens live as you change parameters!

This isn't just a MIDI tool. It's an 'everything in its right place' tool.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gDJUIrecE8?rel=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Articulations are ways of varying performance attributes when using large and complex multi-sample libraries, often Orchestral libraries. Articulations are usually triggered via keyswitches (and the terms are often used interchangeably). Keyswitches are _usually_ specific midi notes, that exist outside the range of the instrument, that are used to change the current performance characteristics of the instrument. Keyswitches can also be CC or program change as well.

As you can imagine, managing this data can be problematic, and very few DAWs have solutions to this problem. Enter Reaticulate.

Reaticulate gives you a simple GUI for managing articulation data in your MIDI based performances. I suggest watching the video above to get a better idea of what Reaticulate offers. If you are someone that often uses large orchestral libraries then I think you will be very pleased.

[Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) and [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com) are hugely popular products because of their session view.

Guitars are peculiar instruments in that the chord forms differ greatly from the piano that most of us use to input MIDI. A big part of creating authentic sounding guitar parts is getting the chord shapes correct.

Enter MIDI Guitar Chord Tool. It allows you to quickly enter common guitar chord voicings, inversions _and_ add strumming.

It's not just for guitar either. It works fantastic for creating thick synth chords or a beginning for various forms of composition.

Orchestral composition can be tedious. Hundreds of tracks, thousands upon hundreds of thousands of events. Nearly unmanagable amounts of automation and MIDI CC.

Except, it can be _easy_. OTR brings together a comprehensive set of workflows for the monumental task of modern orchestral composition. Check out the video series. There's features here that _no other DAW_ can compare with.

Layering items for creating sound effects or more powerful musical samples is a common task these days. Often a designer will want to create a variance of items to create interest and have an arsenal of sounds to use later.

ExtremRaym's shuffle items scrips let you do this. You set your snap offsets for the layers, laid across tracks, then you can shuffle the layers around to create new variations. Very useful.

Not only that, but you can simply shift around each _column_. This allows you to move around layers, but maintain the same layer composition.

**That's not all**. Check out the thread for even more great layering and item organization scripts!

RS5K Manager is an integrated browser and step sequencer for using Reaper's SamplOmatic5000. It allows you to store directories for quick recall, quickly map samples to new instances of SamplOmatic5000 on the selected track while set to the assigned note.

From there it includes a simple step sequencer for writing midi to the currently selected item, or optionally the ability to drop in references to the current sample as an audio item on a child track.

RS5K manager isn't exactly a powerhouse, but it is a great shortcut to getting started on a track. It's also another awesome example of what can be done with ReaScripts.

{:/nomarkdown}

Veto_gfxanalyzer is a multi-channel analyzer. You can route multiple tracks to it and the spectrum of the tracks are overlaid.

Use is simple after installation. You insert Veto_gfxanalyzer.jsfx on a track. Route the tracks you want to that track with the routings of 1/2->1/2, 1/2->3/4, 1/2->5/6 etc... incrementing the destination channel each time. This means you're sending audio to a different channel on the same track, and gfxanalyzer reads those channels.

You can also assign the track colours to the analyzer output by selecting the Veto_gfxanalyzer window and running the `Script: Set colors of focused Veto_gfxanalyzer to tracks sending on channels 1-16.eel` script.

Very cool and free script!

WiredChain gives you a modular like interface to FX channel routing. It has its own undo and redo stack, FX selection, you can select curvy style wires, I/O pin management, graphical organization of plug-ins and more features.

If you have ever wanted a modular FX system and reaper then here you go, it is a beautiful example of what scripting in Reaper is capable of.

[eugen2777's](https://github.com/EUGEN27771/ReaScripts) FXRack is awesome. It serves similar functionality to [TrackFX Routing](#trackfx-routing), but with a much more simple interface.

The bottom graphic above is FXRack. The top is the exact same setup in [TrackFX Routing](#trackfx-routing). There is a pre-fx section that is split in to rows of effects chains. There's 8 parallel effects changes that are then summed to the post-fx stage.

Instruments and effects can be used, and mixed as desired. Each parallel effects chain has pre-gain, post-gain, post-pain, solo and polarity inversion.

This is really an awesome script that exposes Reaper's built-in functionality that provides you essentially a free [Bluecat Patchwork](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_PatchWork/).

Routing in Reaper is very powerful. It can also be very confusing at times, but with this script you can easily manage your routing and track FX.

[Once you find out what you can do with Reaper's Routing]({% post_url 2017-04-18-Reapers-Amazing,-but-Awful,-Almost-Anything-to-Anywhere-Routing %}) then this script will brighten your day.

## Sort focused ReaEQ bands by frequency - [Thread](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=206122)

When using ReaEQ, you can often end up with your numbered bands and all sorts of a crazy order.

This script sorts your ReaEQ bands so that from left to right they are numerically in order.

It may not seem like a big deal, but this puts your bands graphically in line with the tabs on the bottom of the interface. This script is actually surprisingly complex under the hood, so it earns its place here due to its usability and due to the resourcefulness that was required to create it.

Wow. Amazing [Pro-Q like EQ](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-q-2-equalizer-plug-in).

Not only that, but it uses the fantastic [SVF Filters](https://cytomic.com/index.php?q=technical-papers) as described by Andy Simper.

This is seriously one of the best displays of what users can do with scripting capabilities in Reaper.

# General Tools

## Project to HTML or CSV - [Homepage](https://www.extremraym.com/en/downloads/reascripts-html-export/)

Sound designers, foley artists, dialog recorders, sampling maniacs, composers and more often need a way to export metadata of their project to other formats for logging and other tasks.

This script allows you to easily export things like item names, position, length, colour, status, FX metadata and much more... to HTML or CSV for easy viewing and logging.

The HTML export outputs a beautiful table of data for easy browsing. A really amazing tool for a number of workflows.

Advanced Tempo Tool allows you to create complex tempo maps with ease. Often the process of changing tempos/time signatures can be a tedious hair-pulling experience, but ATT lets you keep that hair.

Creating complex time signature changes and tempo changes (which Reaper optionally will stretch item times or stretch the items themselves to) becomes a fun task.

Renaming tracks is time consuming. Renaming items is a horrifying experience. What if you could easily manipulate the names of tracks and items without sacrificing your lifespan?

Track/Item Manipulation let's you do that. Select your tracks _or_ items and easily batch adjust the naming to what you need.

Reaper does offer Takes and Comps, but sometimes you want to have alternate edits or compositions or even recordings.

Sexan's Track List script allows you to easily create, modify and save various edits of a track for easy recall.

Former Cubase user? Then you are already familiar with Cubase's info bar. This is basically it, but better.

If you don't know what the information bar is then you're in for a treat. It displays information about whatever is selected or active. Selections, tracks, items, project settings and other data is displayed in an easy to access bar wherever you wish to put it.

It's a fantastic tool, I now use it instead of a transport. It's that awesome.

## Super 8

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC1-evn7LlU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Super 8 is included in Reaper. It's an 8-track looping tool similar to you may find in a guitar looping pedal.

Super 8 is one of my favorite parts of Reaper. You can use it to build a phrase of a track, a whole track or just have fun layering things. Watch the video above to get a feel for what is possible.

Super 8 is so much fun.

Reaper's basic project launcher leaves some to be desired, in fact I think all DAWs have this issue.

ReaLauncher aims to improve this by giving you a better frontend for finding projects, project templates and track templates.

Combined with [SWS](http://www.sws-extension.org) startup actions and you have a nice launcher to get going with what you need quickly

Awesome script. It allows you to show the tracks you search for, optionally in _real time_, and show their parent/sibling/children via the folder track mechanism.

You can hide/show in the arrange view (TCP) or mixer (MCP). Once you're happy with it you can export an action that you can assign to a button, toolbar or [Radial Menu](#radial-menu---thread) button.

Awesome script. Setup your own quick show/hide of tracks and get on with being awesome in REAPER.

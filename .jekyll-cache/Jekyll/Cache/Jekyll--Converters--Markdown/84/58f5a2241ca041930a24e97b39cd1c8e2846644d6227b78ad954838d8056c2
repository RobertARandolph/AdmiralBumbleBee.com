I"~<p>I have RSI issues at times, particularly when doing any graphics work or heavy audio editing that requires mouse usage.</p>

<p>What happens is that I seem to grip my mouse extra hard when I try to make small movements. I’ve spent years trying to consciously remember to avoid this, but it is both difficult to move the cursor as I want and not squeeze the mouse.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to do <em>at least</em> 1 week of setting my mouse to half-dpi. That means I’m going from 1650 to 825. I’ve also setup my games (such as <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a>) to be using half sensitivity now as well, except with a higher DPI setting.</p>

<p>Hopefully this reduces strain when making small movements and encourages me to use larger and stronger muscle groups when moving the mouse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have 2 more large Studio One blog posts in the works.</p>

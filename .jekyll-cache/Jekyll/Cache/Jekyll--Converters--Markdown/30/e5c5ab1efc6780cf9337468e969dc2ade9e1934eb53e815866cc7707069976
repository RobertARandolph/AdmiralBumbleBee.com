<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_block">Wood blocks</a> are cool. There’s many ways to make them, and many types and shapes.</p>

<p>I’m going to go through two methods of making one appropriate for use with a drum set: minimal tools and ‘appropriate’ tools.</p>

<p>At minimum all you need is a block of wood, a drill and a chisel. You can even substitute a screwdriver and file for the chisel. Anyone can do this!</p>

<p>The design I’m using was created through testing various shapes/styles of wood blocks until I found something that I felt was at home on a full sized drum kit.</p>

<p>So let’s get to it!</p>

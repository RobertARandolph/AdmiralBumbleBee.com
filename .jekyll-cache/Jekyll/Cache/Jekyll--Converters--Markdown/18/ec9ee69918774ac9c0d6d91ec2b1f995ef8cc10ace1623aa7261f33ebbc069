<p>Aftermath of trying out some freehand 25Â° bevel honing on some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neiko%C2%AE-02628A-Carving-Chisel-9-Piece/dp/B003X5KF04/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470857908&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=neiko+chisel">Neiko Chisels</a>. Iâ€™m using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_12?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=shapton+kuromaku&amp;sprefix=Shapton+kuro%2Ckitchen%2C151">Shapton Kuromaku</a> stones at #320, #1000, #5000, #8000, #12000. Stones are flattened with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DMT-D8X-Continuous-Diamond-Extra-Coarse/dp/B001DZOKNY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470858433&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=diasharp+course">DMT Dia-Sharp Coarse</a> and I use <a href="http://www.woodcraft.com/product/152586/honerite-gold-250-ml.aspx">HoneRite Gold</a> on the #8000 and #12000 stones to reduce oxidation.</p>

<p>I returned my <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/US/Wood/page.aspx?p=67707&amp;cat=1,41504">Narex Classic Bevel-Edge Chisels</a> to Lee Valley due to unusually poor edge retention. They accepted the return 3 months out of the return period <em>and</em> after a reasonable amount of use. Very classy.</p>

<p>So for now, all I have are these very cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marples-Woodworking-Chisel-6-Piece-M444SB6N/dp/B000RG2Y56">Irwin Marples</a> OEM/rip-offs to play with. And play with them I shallâ€¦</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been using Reaper for about 1 week now. If you follow my blog then you <a href="/music/2016/10/24/Robert-Ode.html">May know how much I hate Reaper</a>. <a href="/music/2016/10/25/Ugh.html">I couldnâ€™t even muster the discipline last time</a> to go through with trying it.</p>

<p>This time I getting there though. So if you click-through, then youâ€™ll find a pretty sizeable list of some cool stuff that <a href="http://www.reaper.fm">Reaper</a> offers.</p>

<p>(You can expect the vitriolic post to follow soon enough thoughâ€¦ this has been a tremendously painful piece of software to figure out.)</p>

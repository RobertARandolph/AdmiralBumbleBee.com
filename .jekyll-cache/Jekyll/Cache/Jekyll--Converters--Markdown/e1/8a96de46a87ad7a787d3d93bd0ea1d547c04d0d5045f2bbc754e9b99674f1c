I"<p><a href="http://motu.com/newsitems/digital-performer-10-is-now-shipping">Digital Performer 10</a> is out! Thatâ€™s awesome, and normally Iâ€™d be blasting you with content <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>.</p>

<p><em>But Iâ€™m not.</em> Yet.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s coming soonâ€¦</p>

<p>Forcing myself to publish weekly has really cramped me hard. I end up with spare time sitting on drafts I donâ€™t care about, or I end up spending 18 hours on Friday and 18 hours on Saturday to torture myself.</p>

<p>I really miss doing short â€œtipsâ€ type things that I canâ€™t fit in with the weekly style, because I need to focuse on my deadline. I want to do more of those again. I also want the freedom to indulge in random curiosities I dive into on a whim, and write as I do so.</p>

<p>So the next article is coming when itâ€™s ready. Every article after that will come when itâ€™s ready. The total content should <em>increase</em> and it will likely still be ~4 posts a month. The time between articles will be variable though.</p>

<p>(Also 15th <a href="https://www.paypal.me/admiralbumblebee">wedding anniversary coming up</a>â€¦ So yaâ€™ll get to wait while I enjoy that this week.)</p>

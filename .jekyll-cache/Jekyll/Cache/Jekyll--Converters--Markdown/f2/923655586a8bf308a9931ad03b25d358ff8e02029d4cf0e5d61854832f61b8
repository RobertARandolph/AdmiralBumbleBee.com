<h1 id="staff">Staff</h1>

<p>Let‚Äôs first talk about the most important asset of any software: the people. The folks behind Mixbus and Ardour are fantastic. I‚Äôve worked with (and for) a variety of developers that make audio products, particularly DAWs, and largely they are all great people that love what they do.</p>

<p>The people behind Mixbus and Ardour though, have been the most reasonable folks I‚Äôve encountered. While writing reviews I‚Äôve talked to people involved in the projects I‚Äôm critical of and the response is almost always some sort of defense or rationality. When speaking with the Mixbus folks, they‚Äôre more willing to explain the tradeoffs in the design and acknowledge their weaknesses. This signals to me a huge willingness to improve and embrace the user. Not one time in talking to any other company (of nearly every major DAW developer) has someone said to me, of something that‚Äôs not a bug, ‚ÄúYou know what, I think we can do better.‚Äù That was until I spoke with the Mixbus team.</p>

<p>Along with their willingness to approach their product with a genuine honesty, their support is fantastic. You can contact them via <a href="http://mixbus.harrisonconsoles.com/forum/index.php">the forum</a>, <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ardour-mixbus">irc</a> or <a href="mailto:mixbus@harrisonconsoles.com">email</a>. You will be acknowledged and your problem will very likely be dealt with by a real person that‚Äôs interested in you getting back to work. No bureaucracy. No blowing you off because you‚Äôre an idiot (and yes, sometimes we are idiots when we contact support!). Just helpful people that want their product to work for you more than you want it to work.</p>

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>

<p>Mixbus is <strong>not</strong> a feature-packed powerhouse. I‚Äôve discussed many things it does have, but there‚Äôs a lot of things it doesn‚Äôt have.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No comping (think ‚Äòswipe comping‚Äô)</li>
  <li>No always recording</li>
  <li>VCAs are strange from a DAW implementation perspective (though accurate to the harrison 32c console)</li>
  <li>No audio warping</li>
  <li>No notation</li>
  <li>Midi editing is basic</li>
  <li>Limited selection of free included processors</li>
  <li>No pitch editing (inline pitch changing on monophonic sources)</li>
  <li>No <a href="http://www.synchroarts.com/products/vocalign-pro/overview">vocalign-like</a> features</li>
  <li>No spectral editing</li>
  <li>No arrangement tools like <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/en/home.html">Bitwig</a> or <a href="https://www.ableton.com">Ableton Live</a></li>
  <li>No modular environment</li>
  <li>No modulation system</li>
  <li>No hardware integration</li>
  <li>No VST3 support</li>
  <li>Minimal included sound content</li>
</ul>

<p>There‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ but these are just things that I‚Äôve been asked about or seen mentioned fairly frequently about features people enjoy in other products.</p>

<p>That doesn‚Äôt mean Mixbus is bad by any means. In fact I would argue that the unique set of features it offers, along with a very fluid workflow, are more valuable than any single marketing buzz. The mixing workflow is fantastic (minus the VCA system which I personally don‚Äôt like). The basic editing workflow is fantastic (arguably the best I‚Äôve used along with Pro Tools keyboard focus, and SAW Studio‚Äôs native editing). Setting up and recording audio is brilliant.</p>

<p>If you sit back and think about what you spend the most time doing, I‚Äôm fairly certain that most folks will find that Mixbus excels at 95% of it. Yes that 5% remaining would be super easy to do in another DAW, but there‚Äôs no rules saying you couldn‚Äôt just pop that track in another product and go back to work in Mixbus.</p>

<p>Selling products has always been about features, and even my own <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart</a> is about features. What really matters most of the time is how well something does its most common and basic task. Currently this is where Mixbus excels. If this is retained while they pile on marketable features then it will be a formidable product in the very near future.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>There really isn‚Äôt much to say as a conclusion. I think that Mixbus is a product nearly everyone should have.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a number of people that will require other software to create a full environment for their craft, but I think that at the core of any workflow, Mixbus is a strong option.</p>

<p>Having worked extensively with a number of DAWs, this is the <em>first</em> time I think I would make such a recommendation. Pro Tools could fit this role, but I abhor Avid‚Äôs business decisions. SAWStudio could, but it‚Äôs basically dead. Reaper could if you spent ~80 hours setting it up (and probably forgetting half of what you did). Nearly every other product is interchangeable, just a jumble of features with no real strong sense of wholistic design.</p>

<p>Mixbus, right now, offers exactly what every musician needs: a solid foundation.</p>

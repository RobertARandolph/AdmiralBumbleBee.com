I"€	<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Please see the new <a href="/DAW-Chart.html"><strong>DAW Feature Chart</strong></a> for more up-to-date information and a way cooler chart.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve done a couple projects in DP 9.12, Studio One 3.3.1 and Cubase 8.5.20 recently. I‚Äôve spent some serious time investigating my workflow(s) and manual re-reading. I also went through and read the changelogs and watched the video trailer for the last many versions of each product.</p>

<p>I purchased an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro 9.7‚Äù</a> and subsequently I‚Äôve been using the remote control apps available again. That has had a <strong>huge</strong> influence on my work for the better. It is really an amazing thing to use when you don‚Äôt have an assistant.</p>

<p>My time spent in each DAW as a percentage, according to <a href="https://manytricks.com/timesink/">Time Sink</a> has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Studio One - 43%</li>
  <li>Cubase 26%</li>
  <li>DP - 21%</li>
  <li>Renoise - 12%</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be a bit of a rounding error there ;)</p>

<p>Overall I‚Äôve become a good bit less annoyed with Studio One. Largely because I‚Äôve had someone go over how to basically totally avoid using drag&amp;drop at all. I also have not had a single crash with 3.3.1. <a href="% post_url Studio-PoisOne">If you read my last post about Studio One</a>, then you may be surprised by how much I‚Äôve been using it. Yeah, I am too. I should revisit that post soon to help clarify the things that I‚Äôve come to understand about the software, and some of the really useful workflow improvements I‚Äôve discovered in it. Largely though‚Ä¶ if the documentation wasn‚Äôt <strong>so incredibly awful</strong>, I probably would have liked S1 a lot more than I did 4 months ago. 3.3.1 being very stable also has made a difference in how patient I‚Äôve been able to be while using it.</p>

<p>Cubase has been crashing <strong>a lot</strong> lately for some reason. <a href="https://www.steinberg.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=226&amp;t=103301">I have not yet been able to figure it out</a>.</p>

<p>Still, DP is king in my book. I will still use Studio One until Motu does something about the awful multi-track editing and comping (comparatively) in DP. Where it matters to me though, DP is definitely the best.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs the updated DAW Comparison chart.</p>

<p>Recently <a href="http://motu.com/newsitems/digital-performer-91-is-now-shipping">MOTU released Digital Performer 9.1</a> and one of the major enhances was advertised to be reduced latency in OS X with “industry-leading overall latency performance.”</p>

<p>I was very skeptical of this. There’s certain physical realities that can’t be overcome without some sort of misadvertising. So what do we do? We test it!</p>

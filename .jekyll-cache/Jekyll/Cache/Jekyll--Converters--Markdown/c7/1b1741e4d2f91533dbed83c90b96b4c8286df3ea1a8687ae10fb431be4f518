I"±<p>A small note that the <a href="/ReaperScripts.html">Reaper Script Showcase</a> has been updated with a number of new scripts, videos and faster loading time!</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s also been some discussions about the <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart</a> on <a href="https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=201226">the Reaper forums</a> and <a href="https://vi-control.net/community/threads/found-this-nice-daw-feature-comparison-chart.66997/">vi-control.net</a>. The feedback isnâ€™t always positive, but Iâ€™m constantly trying to improve relative to any feedback given.</p>

<p>The <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart</a> has also received a number of updates due to these discussions.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, criticisms, rants or just wanna say thanksâ€¦ please contact me! audiolabs via gmail.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - December 30th - I added a new Extensibility category and updated a few other ratings.</p>

<p>The <a href="/music/2016/05/31/Studio-compOnents-review.html">Studio One Effects Review</a> and <a href="/music/2016/06/05/Studio-ContraptiOnes.html">Studio One Instruments Review</a> appear to have been one of the more popular posts on my blog according to analytics. In a close second Place are the <a href="/music/2016/12/10/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-1.html">Digital Performer</a> series.</p>

<p>So now I’m going to review the included audio effects in the latest from Steinberg: <a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html">Cubase 9 Pro</a>.</p>

<p>There’s 70+ of them. So hang on tight! (and please read the ‘Rating’ section first!)</p>

<p>Spoiler: Overall rating</p>

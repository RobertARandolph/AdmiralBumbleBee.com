  <div class="video-caption">A real click track in Reaper</div>

<p>I like to have a real click <strong>track</strong> in my project. That means that I want have a <strong>track</strong> with the click that I can put on effects or use as a sidechain source. I don’t want a phantom click source that just plays when the project plays. I want a track.</p>

<p>Reaper allows you to do this, but if you want a button on your toolbar to control that track then you gotta write a script or two to make that work. So that’s what I’ve done.</p>

<p>Click through to see how I setup a <em>real</em> click track, with effects, and a toolbar button that controls it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m 20 days in to my 30 days with <a href="http://www.reaper.fm">Reaper</a>.</p>

<p>In the last 5 days, my time spent in each DAW as a percentage, according to <a href="https://manytricks.com/timesink/">Time Sink</a> has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaper - 99%</li>
  <li>DP - 1%</li>
</ul>

<p>I am actually getting along with Reaper very nicely now. Itâ€™s not required much customization, but a lot of learning about what <em>can be done</em>. In this post Iâ€™m going to go over some of the things that Iâ€™ve changed that really improved the experience for me.</p>

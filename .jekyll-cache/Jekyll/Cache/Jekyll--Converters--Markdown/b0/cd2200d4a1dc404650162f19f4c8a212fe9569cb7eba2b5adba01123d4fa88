<p>Recently I was told by my neurologist that the frequent pain/tingling/itching/weird sensations all over my body are likely due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_fiber_peripheral_neuropathy">small fiber peripheral neuropathy</a>, which is not uncommon in people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_autonomic_failure">autonomic failure</a> such as I’ve been diagnosed with. I’ve dealt with the autonomic failure for years, and while it’s a pain, I’ve mostly managed.</p>

<p>The neuropathy is affecting my ability to be a musician though. Specifically, it’s greatly affected by ability to play drums. After playing for an hour, my hands will tingle for hours or days after. I think that this is partially due to me holding my drumsticks too close to the butt.</p>

<p>For a much more detailed look at the phenomenon that I think is contributing to my issue <a href="http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/bats/sting-damp.html">read this article</a>.</p>

<p>To help alleviate that I’ve decided to make a modification to my drumsticks which <a href="/music/2016/06/24/Make-your-own-Drumsticks.html">I already make myself</a>.</p>

<p>Let me walk you through the basic process.</p>

<p>Trigger alert: I frequently mix imperial and metric. Whichever label I present first is the one that I used when making this. I have my reasons for mixing measurements (largely due to available tooling in the US), and if this bothers you then… well… too bad.</p>

<p>I also mix decimal and fractional measurements.</p>

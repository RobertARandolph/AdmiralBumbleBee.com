<p>Cutting threaded rod is a pain. <a href="http://www.dewalt.com/products/power-tools/cable-cutting-and-crimping/20v-max-threaded-rod-cutter/dcs350b">Even with the correct equipment</a> it can be error prone.</p>

<p>If you have a saw, a drill and a short piece of wood then you can quickly make a jig that allows you to make repeatable cuts on threaded rod or bolts.</p>

<h1 id="necessary-equipment">Necessary Equipment</h1>

  <a href="/assets/ThreadJig/Start.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/ThreadJig/Thumbnails/Start.jpg" alt="Start">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">Just some wood and rod</div>

<p>All you need is a piece of wood about that‚Äôs thicker than your threaded rod, the threaded rod, a saw and a drill bit.</p>

<p>The drill bit needs to be <em>at least</em> as long as the resulting threaded rod. Your piece of wood can‚Äôt be any longer than twice the working length of the drill bit.</p>

<h1 id="marking-1">Marking #1</h1>

  <a href="/assets/ThreadJig/Mark1.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/ThreadJig/Thumbnails/Mark1.jpg" alt="Marking the length">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">Marking the resulting length</div>

<p>Mark the length of the resulting cut rod on the wood. The short 1.5‚Äù (4cm) section will house the resulting cut-off rod.</p>

<h1 id="marking-2">Marking #2</h1>

  <a href="/assets/ThreadJig/Mark2.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/ThreadJig/Thumbnails/Mark2.jpg" alt="Marking round 2">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">Marking the hole location</div>

<p>Now we need to drill a hole through the wood piece. The hole needs to be centered in one axis, and about 1/3 of the width from the other edge.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs likely that you will have to drill the hole from both sides. Just mark the same thing on both sides and do that.</p>

<h1 id="drill">Drill</h1>

  <a href="/assets/ThreadJig/Drill.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/ThreadJig/Thumbnails/Drill.jpg" alt="Drilled to size">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">After the hole is drilled</div>

<p>When the hole is drilled, this is your resulting situation.</p>

<p>Draw a line along the waste side that is centered along the hole you drilled. Back in the second marking stage, you should have already made marks on the ends at 1/3 the width of the wood. Connect those 1/3 width marks.</p>

<p>Now we need to cut 2 more slots and we‚Äôre done!</p>

<h1 id="cutting-the-wood">Cutting the wood</h1>

  <a href="/assets/ThreadJig/CutWood.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/ThreadJig/Thumbnails/CutWood.jpg" alt="Cut Wood">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">Cutting the holding slot through the hole</div>

<p>Cut along the line you just drew but <strong>do not</strong> intersect the first line that you drew. Leave about 1cm or 1/2‚Äù of wood. Look at the image to see where I stopped.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm using a <a href="http://giantcypress.net/post/533383638/the-problem-with-buying-a-japanese-saw">japanese ryoba</a> to cut my line, but you can simply use the tool that you‚Äôll cut the rod with. Anything that cuts a thin line will work.</p>

<p>This is the final stage in creating the jig. Reference the <a href="#conclusion">conclusion</a> or <a href="#using-it">using it</a> section to see how it should look if you‚Äôre unsure what you‚Äôre making.</p>

<h1 id="using-it">Using it</h1>

  <a href="/assets/ThreadJig/Used.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/ThreadJig/Thumbnails/Used.jpg" alt="In use">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">Directly after using the jig</div>

<p>Simply place your rod inside the hole so that nothing pokes out the ‚Äòkeep‚Äô side.</p>

<p>Use some sort of reciprocating saw (like a jigsaw), or a hacksaw with a metal-cutting blade to cut down your line until you feel that you are through the rod. That‚Äôs it. Your keeper will come out of the keeper side with almost no burr and ready to use.</p>

<p>You may want to quickly sand the resulting cut on the keeper, but usually the result is immediately useable. The only thing to worry about is that the thread-start might be fragile. Rub the thread start on some sandpaper to taper it off, and you‚Äôll be less likely to <a href="http://www.fastener-world.com.tw/0_magazine/ebook/pdf_download/FW_142_E_264.pdf">cross thread</a> when using it.</p>

<p>Un-clamp the vice, slide your rod back over and cut your next rod.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">The result</div>

<p>This jig takes about 2 minutes to make and allows you to accurately cut threaded rod and bolts with minimal fuss. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anyone use this method before, so hopefully my idea helps you out!</p>

<p>(I‚Äôm sure someone‚Äôs independently come up with this on their own, but I haven‚Äôt seen it‚Ä¶ congrats if you thought of it too!)</p>

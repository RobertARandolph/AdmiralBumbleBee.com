<p>That’s it. I’m done with Studio One for now.</p>

<p>I wish I could have continued this blog about my evaluation of it, but the number of crashes I’ve encountered is just mind-boggling. A lot of these crashes are reproducible and in areas that surely are commonly used.</p>

<p>I also really miss chunks, POLAR, the commands window, the <em>huge</em> number of useful commands for navigating, far superior zooming capabilities and some of the MOTU plugins that are included. Especially the Masterworks Leveler.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll try it again at version 3.5 or something. I don’t know. Good luck to Presonus.</p>

<p>Back to my beloved <a href="http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp">Digital Performer</a>!</p>

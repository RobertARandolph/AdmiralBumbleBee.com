<p>Often people say that they enjoy my website because of the detail that I go into. I recently acquired a <a href="https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/lumix-interchangeable-lens-ilc-cameras/DC-G9KBODY.html">Panasonic G9</a> and some lenses, so I thought that I would take some time to do some photography in the studio.</p>

<p>What follows is some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_photography">macro photos</a>, along with a wider angle shot, of various things around the studio.</p>

<p>These images were stacked for me in <a href="https://zerenesystems.com">Zerene Stacker</a>. The necessity of this is something that may be covered in another post. Getting these photos took me about 12 hours, and even then I’m not fully happy with them.</p>

<p><strong>ALL OF THESE IMAGES ARE CLICKABLE FOR LARGER VERSIONS!</strong></p>

<p>This is also my second article in a row without an accompanying video. I have nothing to really talk about on video, so I’m not making a useless video of me just jabbering. They’ll come as they come… especially after <a href="https://www.namm.org">NAMM</a>.</p>

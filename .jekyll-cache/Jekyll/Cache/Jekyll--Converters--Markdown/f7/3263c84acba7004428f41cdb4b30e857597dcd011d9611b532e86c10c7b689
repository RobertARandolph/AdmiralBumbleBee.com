<p>Ok, I have your attention. It’s actually a script, but it’s free and it’s awesome.</p>

<p>The script is called <a href="https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=186637">Radial Menu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BUT WAIT</strong> This is not just another way to mouse around menus. I aim on showing you how this will allow you to utilize key commands in a more structured and easy to remember method.</p>

<p>On with the show…</p>

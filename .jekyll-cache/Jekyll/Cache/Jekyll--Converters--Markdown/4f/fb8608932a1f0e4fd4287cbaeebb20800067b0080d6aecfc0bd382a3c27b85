<p>Ok, you should know by now that I <a href="/programming/2018/12/15/Why-I-hate-Windows.html">dislike Windows</a>. As such I decided to get this all out of the way as fast as possible.</p>

<p>So what follows is my thoughts on <em>nearly</em> every aspect of Cakewalk. I intentionally left out some parts that I didnâ€™t think warrant mention, and Iâ€™m certain I missed a few things.</p>

<p>This post is 12,530 words, 71,893 characters and has 118 images/videos. Not to mention all the code I write to create media, extract information, cross-check the manual and other bits. Iâ€™ve spent countless hours (200+ now) digging into the software in the last month, reading the manual, scouring the forums, cross-referencing, etcâ€¦ If Iâ€™ve made any glaring errors please leave a comment or contact me and I will fix it. If you disagree with my opinions then feel free to let me know and we can discuss it. Iâ€™m pliable and can be convinced by a rational well-reasoned argument. I will also update the post.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s some things <a href="https://discuss.cakewalk.com/">shaking up at Bandlab</a>, so this may not be my final post in the series for now, but I intend it to be. My thoughts on Cakewalk as a whole are at the end.</p>

<p><a href="/DAW-Chart.html">The DAW Chart is updated with Cakewalk as well</a>. As of publishing this, I donâ€™t even know what the final score is (thatâ€™s calculated client side). I avoid looking so I donâ€™t subconsciously try to smidge an overall rating ahead of another DAW.</p>

<p>Without further ado letâ€™s hop into it.</p>

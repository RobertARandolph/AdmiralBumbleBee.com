<p>If you donâ€™t know, I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder">Panic Disorder</a>. I quite randomly, and frequently, have awful panic attacks. I was offered a device called the <a href="http://store.heartmath.com/emwave2">emWave 2</a> which is a biofeedback device.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been using it for a few months and in this post Iâ€™m going to cover my experiences.</p>

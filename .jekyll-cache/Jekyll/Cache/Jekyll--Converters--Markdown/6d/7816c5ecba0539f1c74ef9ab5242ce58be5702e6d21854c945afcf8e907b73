<p>I have a <a href="https://us.focusrite.com/firewire-audio-interfaces/saffire-pro-40">Focusrite Saffire Pro 40</a> that is setup as part of my live rig. To change the master volume, it requires that I reach down and blindly grab the correct one of about 30 knobs. If you havenâ€™t guessed, I rarely get it.</p>

<p>The solution is simple. Make a bigger knob out of sapele, of course.</p>

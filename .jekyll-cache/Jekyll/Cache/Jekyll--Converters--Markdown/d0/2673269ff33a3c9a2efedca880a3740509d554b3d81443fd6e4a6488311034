<p>I became annoyed with having a 3ft boom sticking out from the left side of my drumset. So I hopped on the lathe and made a smaller boom out of <a href="http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/sapele/">Sapele</a>.</p>

<p>5/8‚Äù-27tpi threads in wood really are a pain. Luckily I have <a href="http://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/03936275">the correct die</a> for the job.</p>

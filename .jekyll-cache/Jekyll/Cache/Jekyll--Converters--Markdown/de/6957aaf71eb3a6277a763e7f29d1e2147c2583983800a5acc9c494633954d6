<p>As Iâ€™ve been a Digital Performer user for a couple years, I thought Iâ€™d do a bit of a pseudo-review on DP. Iâ€™m going to cover some of the cool (and often unique) features in DP9, and I will also cover some of the downsides of using DP.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out the other DP Features posts!</p>

<p>I’ve long been on a quest for the perfect thumb pick. I switch frequently between tapping and strumming when I play, and I basically can not play comfortably without a thumbpick. I’ve tried basically everything out there. Everything is either too stiff, too long, too small, too oddly shaped or too… something.</p>

<p>Recently I found the <a href="http://fredkellypicks.com/product/delrin-bumblebee-teardrop/">Fred Kelly BUMBLEBEE Teardrop thumb pick</a>. It’s damn near perfect, almost. The problem is that even the largest size is half a size too small for me. I set out to fix that so I could <em>maybe</em> finally have a pick that’s perfect for me.</p>

<p>So here’s the best method that I’ve figured out.</p>

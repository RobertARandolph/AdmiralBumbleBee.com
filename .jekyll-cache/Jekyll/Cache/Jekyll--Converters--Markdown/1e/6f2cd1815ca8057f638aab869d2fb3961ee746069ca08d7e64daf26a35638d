<p>Itâ€™s that time!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/?">FLStudio 20</a> is out and itâ€™s time for me to take it to task.</p>

<p>This review will most likely take more than 30 days, because Iâ€™ll also be covering <a href="https://www.image-line.com/plugins/category/all/">every single Image Line product</a> as well.</p>

<p>I am reviewing an NFR copy of the entire <a href="https://www.image-line.com">Image Line</a> suite of software. I did not pay for the products in this review, however Iâ€™m not going to tone down my review in any way. If you feel that I am then please call me out on it.</p>

<p>I may be throwing in a fun twist to the format this time as well ;) See you again in 3-4 days!</p>

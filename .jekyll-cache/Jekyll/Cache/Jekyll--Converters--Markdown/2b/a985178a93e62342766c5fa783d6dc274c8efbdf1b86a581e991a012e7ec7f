<p>Firstly, I’ve added a Donate Button in the menu bar, and at the bottom of every new post. Some of these posts take me a lot of time, and I will also be relaying how much time it took me to create the post.</p>

<p>On another topic, I have a thing I do called my “Monthly Challenge”. Once a month I purposely challenge myself to something new. It may be creating a new habit, changing a habit, trying new software etc… I’ve written about some of these in my DAW posts, but I will be trying to post about all of them on my blog now.</p>

<p>This month I’ve decided to stop using <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> for text editing. I’ve decided to try the following editors in its place: <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>, <a href="https://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a> and <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>.</p>

<p>I will tell you that off the bat, I absolutely <strong>LOVE</strong> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a>. I’ve written the last 2 components for this site and the last 2 posts with it. I’ve done a small C project and a few python scripts as well. It’s <em>FANTASTIC</em>. I may not even try the other editors! (Well that’s a lie. I triet Atom first, and it was slow as molasses, so I won’t be going back to that.)</p>

<p>There might be a hint as to what I’m working on now in this post. It shouldn’t be difficult to spot :) It’s <em>A LOT</em> of work though, so give me a day or two to finish up.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the part where I go a ridiculous amount of work trying and testing plugins. What follows is a short review of every effect plug-in included with Mixbus and the commercially available <a href="http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus-plugins.html">plug-ins from Harrison</a> and the included <a href="http://x42-plugins.com/x42/">x42 plugins</a> that are installed with Mixbus.</p>

<p><strong>THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONSIDER THE MIXBUS MIXER</strong> <a href="/music/2017/09/18/Mixbus-32c-The-Mixer.html">I covered that elsewhere</a>. Mixbus comes with quite a few things outside of the plugins, so be aware of that.</p>

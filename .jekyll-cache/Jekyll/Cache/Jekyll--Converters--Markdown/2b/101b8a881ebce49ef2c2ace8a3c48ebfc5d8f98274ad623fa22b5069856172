<p>This is a big one for me. <a href="https://cakewalk.bandlab.com">Cakewalk</a> is a Windows only DAW. I <strong>HATE</strong> Windows (which I may explain why, in depth, later).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be spending 30 days working with Cakewalk as much as possible and leaving my thoughts as usual.</p>

<p>This is just an announcement post. I need at least a week head-start. I spend a great deal of time ensuring my content is accurate and that my opinions are well-founded.</p>

<p>Sorry for the lack of content, but I donâ€™t want to just throw out half-assed things to meet my self-imposed weekly deadline.</p>

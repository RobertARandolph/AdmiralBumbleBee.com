<p>Your favorite part of the week has arrived! Part 7 day!</p>

<p>As Iâ€™m slowly becoming more familiar with Waveform, you may notice that the review is also becoming more focused. Today Iâ€™m going to cover the good, the bad and the weird of recording in Waveform 9. Recording Audio and MIDI are the topics.</p>

<p>You may notice that this article is perhaps more substantive than others, and thatâ€™s because this is what I do day in and day out. I record. I still put in a lot of effort to other sections, but this topic comes more naturally to me due to how Iâ€™ve been using Waveform this last month and my general life experience.</p>

<p>This article has some of my favorite features in the software, and some things that other DAWs really should learn from, but like with all software thereâ€™s some small things that sour the experience a bit more than it seems like they should. Regardless, Waveform excels in this areaâ€¦ mostly.</p>

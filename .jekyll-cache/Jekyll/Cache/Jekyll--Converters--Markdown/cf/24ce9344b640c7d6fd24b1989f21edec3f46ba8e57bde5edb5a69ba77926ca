<p>Recently <a href="http://sonimus.com/products/StonEQ4k/">Sonimus released StonEQ 4K</a> which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_State_Logic#4000_series">SSL 4k series</a> EQ emulation.</p>

<p><strong>I bought it.</strong></p>

<p>If you read <a href="/music/2017/11/21/What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ.html">my most recent post about what I want in an EQ</a>, you might be confused. Why did I purchase an EQ that has only <a href="/music/2017/11/21/What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ.html#what-i-do-not-want">what I do not want</a> and none of the <a href="/music/2017/11/21/What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ.html#what-i-want">features that I do want</a>?</p>

<p>Read more to find out.</p>

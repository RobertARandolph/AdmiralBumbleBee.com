<p>I have nowhere in my studio to properly put headphones. Itâ€™s rather annoying.</p>

<p>So today I decided to make some simple hooks to screw on to my desk. I used a small port of a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-4-in-x-96-in-Yellow-Pine-Kiln-Dried-Stud-232971/202519496">pine 2x4</a>. The amount of wood used is about $0.56usd of wood.</p>

<p>The total cost of tools used was about $4,000usd. You could easily do this with a chisel, a $10 saw, a drill and some drill bits. Maybe Iâ€™ll do something like that next time.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s get on to it!</p>

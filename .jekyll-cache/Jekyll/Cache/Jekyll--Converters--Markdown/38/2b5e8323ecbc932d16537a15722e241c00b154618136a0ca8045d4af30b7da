I"´<p>Iâ€™ve added more categories to the DAW chart, clarified some things, updated some ratings in response to criticism/discussion and improved some explanations.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m always open to ideas on how to improve it. Feel free to e-mail me via gmail. The bit before the @ is <code class="highlighter-rouge">audiolabs</code>. Even better is to comment on the <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart page</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks as always!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been slack with the Cubase posts. I was planning on writing a post about the things that bother me, but thereâ€™s basically nothing so far! The only exception is the lack of multi-track freewarping.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m going to once again go over some features that I like.</p>

<h1 id="plug-in-manager">Plug-in Manager</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/Cubase/PluginManager.png" alt="Unusually good plug-in manager." /></p>

<p>The plug-in manager is fantastic. You can create your own â€˜collectionâ€™ with various folders and organize your plug-ins as necessary. It seems simple, but surprisingly this is difficult to get nice collections organized in other DAWs.</p>

<p>It has a function to remove unavailable plug-ins, which is not the default behaviour thankfully! Nothing more annoying than not having your iLok and suddenly having plugins disappear from your carefully organized folders.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s possible to have multiple plug-in locations set.</p>

<p>Plug-ins are <em>not</em> automatically alphabetized. <strong>You choose</strong> the order of the plug-ins. I do wish there was various options to automatically sort by date installed, alphabetical, most used, least used and various other ways. As it stand s though, itâ€™s nice that thereâ€™s nothing automatically applied.</p>

<p>There is a function to show plug-ins not currently in a collection. How amazingly useful. I actually havenâ€™t seen a DAW with that, and itâ€™s very useful when you have a lot of plugins to organize and you miss a few. Nothing more fun than going weeks without a plug-in you frequently use because it doesnâ€™t show up in your plug-in list.</p>

<p>You can also have <em>multiple</em> collections. If there are plug-ins that you only use when working on EDM or film, you can set stuff up how you want it. Easy.</p>

<p>In my experience, this is the best plug-in management system in a DAW. Yet another reason why Iâ€™m really enjoying Cubase 8.5.</p>

<h1 id="control-room">Control Room</h1>

<p>I really canâ€™t explain this as well as a 15 minute video can. There are so many useful features here, even if you donâ€™t need the cue mixes.</p>

<p>Watch this video and be amazed. Why doesnâ€™t every DAW have this?!</p>

<p>Control Room allows you to control multiple monitors (with different mixes and master plugins), have different click feeds, panning, levels, downmix presets, routing, mono/stereo switch etcâ€¦</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t want to watch the video, just know that Control Room gives you a lot of options for quickly controlling what comes out of your speakers.</p>

<h1 id="project-logical-editor">Project Logical Editor</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/Cubase/ProjectLogicalEditor.png" alt="PLE in action" /></p>

<p>Ever wanted to find something in your project and do something to it? Of course you have.</p>

<p>The Project Logical Editor allows you to do very fine searching of your project to locate basically any â€˜thingâ€™. Notes, parts, containers, ranges, names or even properties of things. You can have multiple filters applied and you can nest them as you wish much like if you were doing if/then/else statements in your favorite programming language.</p>

<p>Once you have â€˜foundâ€™ the items you are looking for, you can do things to them. Move, trim, set colour, stretch, delete, etcâ€¦ You can do multiple of these things at once in any order and nest them how you want.</p>

<p>There are also a great number of excellent examples and presets.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Cubase/PLEOptions.png" alt="So many things to do!" /></p>

<p>Once you get used to the PLE, it opens up a whole new world of things you can try in a project. Want to modulate a selection of audio in a specific time range, but only on the bass tracks? Easy, takes ~30 seconds. Want to nudge every snare track across a huge project? No more zooming out and selecting various little bits.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This may seem like a short post, but the power provided to you by the PLE and Control Room is huge and unrivaled. The plug-in manager is also a superlative implementation of a feature that every DAW should have (but doesnâ€™t!).</p>

<p>As I explore Cubase I find that it not only competently implements basic features, but also contains many things that other DAWs have not even begun to implement yet.</p>

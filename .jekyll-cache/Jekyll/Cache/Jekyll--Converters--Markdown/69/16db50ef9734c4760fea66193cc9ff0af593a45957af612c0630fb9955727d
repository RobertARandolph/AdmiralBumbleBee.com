<p><a href="http://rtom.com/moongel-damper-pad/">Moongels are awesome</a> products for damping the resonant ringing on drums. The downside is that they are surprisingly expensive (about $2usd each pad) and drums are a dirty environment. The stickiness of them deteriorates over time and they lose their usefulness.</p>

<p>Recently I was cleaning my moongels, which I‚Äôve been using for about 16 years, and I thought, ‚ÄúI wonder how other people do this?‚Äù. It turns out that I could find no information on that. Since I think 16 years is a <em>pretty good run</em> with the same set of moongels, perhaps my method is sufficient.</p>

<p>So in this post I‚Äôm going to help you find alternatives to Moongels and show you how to clean moongels to a like-new state so that they can be re-used time and time again.</p>

<p><strong>p.s.</strong> This whole process works great on polyurethane and silocone <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Fashion-Silicone-Reusable-Concealers/dp/B01JLVS726/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510425996&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=nipple+cover">Nipple Covers</a>. The sort of thing women use for modesty or anyone uses to avoid chaffing. Just substitute ‚Äòmoongel‚Äô for ‚Äònipple cover‚Äô and you‚Äôre in business. It works great on both.</p>

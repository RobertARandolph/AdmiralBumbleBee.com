<p><a href="https://www.fabfilter.com">Fabfilter</a> makes amazing products with amazing GUIs. I think every modern music producer or engineer knows this by now.</p>

<p>I have found myself to being too reliant on their products though, so for my next 30 days I’m going to not use <em>any</em> Fabfilter products. When I’m done I’ll write a post explaining why I went back to Fabfilter or why I fell in love with something else.</p>

<p>Currently I have some ideas of what I will replace things with, but that will grow. Read more to find out my plans, and comment if you have any awesome suggestions!</p>

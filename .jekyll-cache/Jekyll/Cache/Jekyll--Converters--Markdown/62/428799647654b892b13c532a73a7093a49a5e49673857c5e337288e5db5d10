<h1 id="mfreeformanalogeq">MFreeformAnalogEQ</h1>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFAEQ.png" alt="MFreeformAnalogEQ">
<div class="image-caption">MFreeformAnalogEQ</div>

<p>MfreeformAnalogEQ is a pretty simple concept. You draw a curve, and the plugin matches that curve the best it can with a selection of minimum-phase biquad filters. You select the maximum number of bands that it can use to match the curve, and how narrow those filter‚Äôs bandwidth can be.</p>

<p>It has a saturation control that I‚Äôll discuss later.</p>

<p>So let‚Äôs just hop straight to the testing!</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<h3 id="frequency--phase">Frequency &amp; Phase</h3>

<p>As usual I‚Äôll be comparing with <a href="https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-q-2-equalizer-plug-in">Fabfilter Pro-Q 2</a> since I‚Äôve confirmed this to be a wholly competent EQ implementation.</p>

<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MAEQTest.png" alt="Test Settings">
<div class="image-caption">Test Settings</div>

<p>Here‚Äôs the test settings used.</p>

<p>I used Fabfilter Pro-Q 2‚Äôs EQ Matching feature to match the MFreeformAnalogEQ settings and here‚Äôs what they look like:</p>

<img src="/assets/Melda/ProQMFAEQ.png" alt="ProQ Match">
<div class="image-caption">Pro-Q Match</div>

<p>Note that I did not attempt to match the <em>drawn</em> curve. I matched the resulting curve. I‚Äôm simply looking at how the filters operate, not if the drawn curve is accurate. The drawn curve in this product will never be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a>.</p>

<h4 id="frequency-result">Frequency Result</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFAEQFreResult.png" alt="Frequency Results">
<div class="image-caption">Frequency Results</div>

<p>We‚Äôre not looking for a perfect match here, since that would be a test of Pro-Q‚Äôs EQ Matching capabilities and nothing more.</p>

<p>What is of note is the lack of cramping (which wouldn‚Äôt happen in this curve anyway!) and the ‚Äúsmoothness‚Äù of the resulting curves. Mostly we can see here that the ‚Äúgreen curve‚Äù in MFreeformAnalogEQ is accurate and does have an ‚Äòanalog like‚Äô response.</p>

<p>This similarity is also important for when comparing phase response.</p>

<h4 id="phase-result">Phase Result</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFAEQPhaResult.png" alt="Phase Results">
<div class="image-caption">Phase Results</div>

<p>Given the similar frequency response, we can confirm that MFreeformAnalogEQ has an ‚Äúanalog like‚Äù frequency response, as we know that Pro-Q 2 does.</p>

<h3 id="saturation">Saturation</h3>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">

<div class="video-caption">Saturation Harmonics</div>

<p>MFreeformAnalogEQ has a saturation knob. As we can see above it adds some saturation, wow!</p>

<p>I have a ~1khz oscillator going in to it, and I‚Äôm analyzing with <a href="http://www.voxengo.com/product/span/">Voxengo Span</a>. (I did not use MAnalyzer due to my unfamiliarity with the product. There were some artifacts when adjusting the oscillator that I could tune out with Span. I am not familar with MAnalyzer to achieve the same result.)</p>

<p>It appears that it adds 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th harmonics. This is an octave, a fifth and an octave. It‚Äôs a rather pleasant sound. The ‚ÄúAnalogness‚Äù of this is very similar to a tube-like saturation. It‚Äôs more on the ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù end of tube saturation with less sizzliness (less harmonic extension, strong even harmonics).</p>

<div class="video-caption">Aliasing...</div>

<p>Here I have oversampling set to 1x. You can see aliasing occur as I increase the frequency of the oscillator.</p>

<p>The aliasing is visible as you watch the harmonics. When they approach that red line (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist‚ÄìShannon_sampling_theorem">nyquist limit</a>) on the right, the ‚Äòreflect‚Äô off it. Now they no longer have a direct proportional relationship to the fundamental frequency. This creates inharmonic noise that‚Äôs just not very pleasant.</p>

<p>Luckily, This product has a nice oversampling section‚Ä¶.</p>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">
<source src="/assets/Melda/MFAEQSat3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<div class="video-caption">No Aliasing!</div>

<p>With oversampling set to 4x, you can see that the harmonics do not reflect. They simply disappear. That‚Äôs what we want to happen!</p>

<p>So if you‚Äôre using heavy saturation with material that has a decent amount of high-frequency information, then you should likely use oversampling. That goes for any product.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>So what do I think about it? First, I have 7 issues with it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Maximum Q isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù. It appears that the Maximum Q parameter changes the Q of all bands. I can create a curve that has a perfect match with 2.00 Q. If I lower the Maximum Q parameter then it changes the Q of all filters used to replicate that curve. If it was truly a ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù setting, then it would use the lowest possible Q to match that band, and only increase to a maximum. This is a mislabeling of the parameter I think, and it does affect the results you can get. However, these changes in results are largely a visual bother, the sonic differences are very minimal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maximum Bands has the same issue as 1. It often uses more bands than is necessary. With anything more than a very simple bell-like curve, it complicates the matched curve well beyond what is necessary to match it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‚ÄúOptimized‚Äù mode is faster, but yields much worse results. Optimized doesn‚Äôt appear to use low or high passes very often and is unsurprisingly less precise matching the curve. The default mode appears to always give better results but is painful to use in realtime, especially if you wish to use the ‚ÄúMaximum Bands‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaximum Q‚Äù parameters. I understand that there‚Äôs tradeoffs made, but I would like more tuning of how these modes work. Default mode is <em>really slow</em> for me. Really, really slow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using analyzer controls often draws! When using the Analyzer controls surrounding the EQ drawing area, I often ended up drawing on my curve and ruining it. <strong>Very</strong> annoying. This appears to be a bug that may be fixed in later versions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No way to reset parts of the curve in Draw mode. You have to switch, <a href="/music/2018/05/11/Melda-Freeform-Part-1.html#points">using the points panel</a>, to node-based drawing to adjust things. It‚Äôs not the most optimal workflow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‚ÄúDraw‚Äù mode does not attempt to use the curve/smoothing features. If you draw something then switch to the point-based view you will have quite the mess. I‚Äôd like if there was a mode that attempted to match the drawn curve with fewer points if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúDraw mode‚Äù is default no matter what. I find that Draw mode is not particularly useful. I‚Äôm often needing to seek-and-destroy, or want to make slight adjustments to what I have already. Draw mode makes this hard. Point-based mode is <em>much</em> easier to work with in a musical context. It‚Äôs very rare that I know exactly the curve I want. It‚Äôs an iterative process, and draw mode does not aide that process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That said‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not all bad!</p>

<ul>
  <li>The saturation sounds surprisingly nice.</li>
  <li>The node-based workflow is great, even though the matching algorithm isn‚Äôt ultra-precise.</li>
  <li>The ‚ÄúRange‚Äù knob is awesome. It scales the intensity of your entire curve with one simple control. Love the changes you‚Äôre making, but what it all a bit less extreme, turn down range. Want more of a change? Turn up range. Every EQ should have a range control that is this simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>For ‚Äúmusical‚Äù applications I found MFreeformAnalogEQ not the nicest to use, but for creative applications it‚Äôs fantastic.</p>

<h1 id="mfreeformequalizer">MFreeformEqualizer</h1>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFEQ.png" alt="MFreeformEQ">
<div class="image-caption">MFreeformEqualizer</div>

<p>MFreeformEqualizer is a total different beast from MFreeformAnalogEQ. You have the same drawing method available, however it defaults to linear phase operation. There‚Äôs no attempt to match the curve with a selection of analog-like filters, it appears to simply be the best match possible.</p>

<p>There is also an additional functionality of curve matching, which I‚Äôll cover next.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-equalizer">Automatic Equalizer</h2>

<img src="/assets/Melda/AutomaticEQ.png" alt="Automatic Equalization">
<div class="image-caption">Automatic Equalization</div>

<p>This is the fun part. You have some choices. You can analyze an input signal, analyze an audio file or draw an input curve. Once you do this, you can save/load the analysis if you desire.</p>

<p>Then you analyze your target. This is usually the track that you wish to equalize. From there you can ‚ÄòEqualize to sound like‚Äô or ‚ÄòSeparate to not sound like‚Äô. They are fairly self-explanatory. Here‚Äôs a quick video showing how easy it is to do this.</p>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">
<source src="/assets/Melda/MEQAnalyse.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<div class="video-caption">Analyzing and applying EQ</div>

<p>Here I‚Äôm working on a track, and I‚Äôm in the ‚Äòmastering‚Äô stage. Using MFreeformEqualizer I grab my reference track to analyez. Then I hit play and click ‚ÄòAnalyze Target‚Äô. Wait a bit for the track to play.</p>

<p>Click ‚ÄòAnalyze Target‚Äô again. Now I can match the spectral response of the 2 tracks, or make them sound dissimilar. The resulting match is really extreme with the default +24db range mode, so I turn that down till my curve is only about +/- 3db. It sounds <em>great</em>.</p>

<p>You could do similar analysis with a kick drum and a bassline. Then you would instead use ‚ÄúSeparate to not sound like‚Äù to effectively ‚Äòcarve space‚Äô for the appropriate element (which is usually the bass). The strength of the effect is once again adjusted with the range knob.</p>

<p>The only thing that you need to be careful of is not to use an MP3 for your reference. The MP3 codec likes to cut off your high end (which reduces information and makes it easier to do lossy encoding and compression). I used an MP3 in my example because it was quick. Don‚Äôt do that!</p>

<h3 id="smoothing">Smoothing</h3>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">
<source src="/assets/Melda/Smoothness.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<div class="video-caption">Smoothing</div>

<p>Your capture curves can be smoothed or not. If you just want the general contour with a nice clean and smooth result, you can increase the smoothing. If you‚Äôre in need of some surgical precision then you can turn smoothing off.</p>

<p>Then when you apply the result with ‚ÄòEqualize‚Äô or ‚ÄòSeparate‚Äô it uses that smoothed analysis to apply your equalization.</p>

<p>Excellent. Cool stuff.</p>

<h2 id="testing-1">Testing</h2>

<p>On to the test! Same procedure here as usual.</p>

<h3 id="frequency-and-phase">Frequency and Phase</h3>

<h4 id="setup-1">Setup</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFEQTest.png" alt="MFreeformEq">
<div class="image-caption">MFreeformEqualizer</div>

<p>Once again I drew a curve. Then I matched it with Pro-Q 2.</p>

<img src="/assets/Melda/ProQMFEQ.png" alt="Pro-Q">
<div class="image-caption">Pro-Q Match</div>

<h4 id="frequency-results">Frequency Results</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFEQFreTest.png" alt="Freq Test">
<div class="image-caption">Frequency Results</div>

<p>Everything looks pretty OK here. MFreeformEqualizer has multiple modes from Low-&gt;Extreme. There‚Äôs also minimum phase and linear phase modes. The default mode is linear phase, so that is what the unlabeled mode is.</p>

<p>The notable thing here is to see what happens on the low-end with either mode. If you need a particularly smooth low-end response then it appears that the linear-phase low mode is your best option. Minimum phase higher modes do some crazy stuff.</p>

<h4 id="phase-results">Phase results</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFEQPhaTest.png" alt="Linear Phase testing">
<div class="image-caption">Linear phase Results</div>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFEQPhaTestMin.png" alt="Minimum Phase Results">
<div class="image-caption">Minimum phase Results</div>

<p>Phase results are exactly what we‚Äôd expect. Minimum phase is all over the place with some of the modes. Linear phase is‚Ä¶ linear phase.</p>

<p>I changed Pro-Q to green to make this easier to see. The ridiculous phase response in the minimum phase modes is due to the strange curve matching of MFreeformEqualizer. It has the <em>expected</em> phase rotation, but a somewhat unexpected curve.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-1">Evaluation</h2>

<source src="/assets/Melda/MFEQPoints.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<div class="video-caption">Points! Points!</div>

<p>Ok. I‚Äôll say it: MFreeformEqualizer is just nicer to use overall than MFreeformAnalogEQ. The only major thing you lose is the saturation, but the resulting EQ sounds better.</p>

<p>I do have the same complaint about the ‚ÄòDraw‚Äô mode being default. Look at the video above. Doesn‚Äôt that point-based system looks so nice? It‚Äôs not as ‚Äòfreeform‚Äô, so I can understand why the draw mode is the default, but from a pure workflow perspective it‚Äôs much nice.</p>

<p>The ‚ÄòAutomatic Equalization‚Äô is great. It doesn‚Äôt require any special routing. It works fast. You can load audio files (to use reference material). For dialogue and SFX work, it‚Äôs amazing. For musical work, it‚Äôs amazing. It just works.</p>

<p>Something that I really enjoyed is that this works great as a guitar cabinet plugin. I can capture the frequency response of a guitar cab by running some noise or a sine-sweep through it then match that to pink noise. Apply the curve and <strong>bam</strong>. I have the response of the guitar cabinet. I can then use the range knob to adjust it.</p>

<p>You can even use it to just copy other plugin‚Äôs frequency response characteristics.</p>

<p>On top of that, it‚Äôs just an easy to use equalizer that gives intuitive results.</p>

<h1 id="mfreeformphase">MFreeformPhase</h1>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFP.png" alt="MFreeformPhase">
<div class="image-caption">MFreeformPhase</div>

<p><a href="/music/2018/02/16/Fixing-Phase-what-why-and-how.html#third-party-tools">I mentioned this plugin when I talked about phase before</a>. Read that article to get <em>somewhat</em> of an idea as to why you may want to use this.</p>

<p>You may also notice that I don‚Äôt have a license for this <em>free</em> plugin. Certain features are locked in the free version, and I neglected to ask for an NFR nor have I paid for it.</p>

<h2 id="testing-2">Testing</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre just looking at the results of MFreeformPhase by itself.</p>

<h3 id="frequency-and-phase-1">Frequency and Phase</h3>

<h4 id="setup-2">Setup</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFPTest.png" alt="MeldaFreeformPhase">
<div class="image-caption">MFreeform</div>

<p>Here‚Äôs our test settings. I specifically set it up with some extreme values in the high and low frequency area to see what will happen.</p>

<h4 id="frequency-results-1">Frequency Results</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFPFreTest.png" alt="MFreeformPhase frequency results">
<div class="image-caption">Frequency testing results</div>

<p>Basically what we‚Äôd expect. Mostly linear frequency response, with some deviance near the low end. Phase rotation of low frequencies requires some very large FFT sizes. It looks like MFreeformPhase uses an 8192 fft size in Extreme mode, which isn‚Äôt entirely sufficient for a linear frequency response extended way in to the low-low frequencies.</p>

<h4 id="phase-results-1">Phase Results</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFPPhaTest.png" alt="MFreeformPhase phase results">
<div class="image-caption">Phase testing results</div>

<p>You may notice that our graph is inverted from what we see in the GUI. Strange‚Ä¶</p>

<h4 id="group-delay-results">Group Delay Results</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFPGd.png" alt="Group Delay">
<div class="image-caption">Group Delay</div>

<p>We can represent phase rotation as a delay of specific frequencies. If we rotate a frequency by a distance (in time) of 1/4 of it‚Äôs wavelength then that‚Äôs a 90¬∞ phase rotation. 1/2 is 180¬∞ etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The graph above is showing us how much each frequency is shifted in time. Even though we have a negative bass rotation specified, we have a forward group delay. Hmm‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not right. We should have a negative group-delay.</p>

<h4 id="further-testing">Further Testing</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/Confirm.png" alt="Confirmation of testing">
<div class="image-caption">Testing Confirmation</div>

<p>I checked to see if my testing was wrong or if MFreeformPhase was. Here‚Äôs how I did it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I took 1 cycle and 1.5 cycles of a 1,000hz waveform.</li>
  <li>I applied a ~180¬∞ phase rotation to it both.</li>
  <li>I applied a ~ -180¬∞ phase rotation to both.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare the results. Positive and Negative phase rotations are identical in result. That‚Äôs not correct! They should be 180¬∞ polarity inverted. This mimics the results in the testing above.</p>

<p>I tried a few other times, and sometimes I got the 180¬∞ result. Hmm‚Ä¶</p>

<h4 id="more-testing">More Testing!</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/Problem.png" alt="There it is!">
<div class="image-caption">The problem, discovered!</div>

<p>I eventually found the issue. Those 2 phase results above are for the exact same graph, there‚Äôs one difference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bass Low Manual (correct) - I manually dragged points in place and measured.</li>
  <li>Bass Low Flip (incorrect) - I manually dragged points in to the <em>opposite</em> places, right clicked the graph and selected ‚ÄúMirror Y‚Äù. Nothing changed‚Ä¶ this is still the un-inverted graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>When testing previously, I was using the ‚ÄúMirror Y‚Äù function, and that was not actually mirroring the internal data it seems.</p>

<p>So there it is. <strong>We found a bug.</strong> It‚Äôs not an <em>important</em> bug, but it‚Äôs a bug.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-2">Evaluation</h2>

<img src="/assets/Melda/MFPEval.png" alt="Evaluation">
<div class="image-caption">MFreeformPhase...</div>

<p>Normally I would report the bug that I found, but I thought it‚Äôd be interesting to go through my bug-hunting process. It‚Äôs likely that this will be fixed in further versions.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also largely inconsequential. Most of the time you would be using this product by listening to the sum of two signals while adjusting MFreeformPhase on one source. The most obvious scenario is when you have 2 mics on the same instrument, the difference in the sound‚Äôs time-of-arrival between the microphones causes phase ‚Äúissues‚Äù. These can be adjusted</p>

<p>That brings us to the non-obvious use of the product: Messing with stereo signals. Often there‚Äôs samples with various effects that aren‚Äôt mono compatible, and you can fix this fairly easily using MFreeformPhase and a goniometer of some sort.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also quite interesting to use in M/S mode.</p>

<p>Given that this plugin is free, I strongly suggest downloading it and spending some time using it. <strong>Remember</strong> it is not particularly useful unless it‚Äôs being used in the context of 2 similar sounds. Hearing phase changes alone is very difficult (if not impossible!). <a href="/music/2018/02/16/Fixing-Phase-what-why-and-how.html">Read this article for some ideas</a></p>

<p>This is why I was asked to write these posts. <a href="/music/2018/05/01/Harrison-AVA-Mastering-EQ-investigation.html">I did an investigative report on AVA Mastering EQ</a> and <a href="http://www.xarcmastering.com">Lorenz of Xarc Mastering</a> asked me about the Melda Freeform series.</p>

<p>So let‚Äôs do it. First some tests, then some discussion</p>

<h2 id="testing-3">Testing</h2>

<h3 id="frequency-and-phase-2">Frequency and Phase</h3>

<h4 id="setup-3">Setup</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/AVAMEQTest.png" alt="Testing curve">
<div class="image-caption">AVA curve</div>

<p>I took this curve in <a href="https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/ava-plugins.html">AVA Mastering EQ</a> and replicated it in <a href="#mfreeformequalizer">MFreeformEqualizer</a> and <a href="#mfreeformanalogeq">MFreeformAnalogEQ</a>.</p>

<p>This was all done by hand. It took me about an hour, but I got very close.</p>

<h4 id="frequency-results-2">Frequency Results</h4>

<img src="/assets/Melda/AVAMFEQFreTest.png" alt="AVA MFreeformEqualizer comparison">
<div class="image-caption">AVA vs MFEQ</div>

<p>So here‚Äôs the comparison between AVA and MFAEQ (MFreeformAnalogEQ) and AVA and (MfreeformEqualizer). MFreeformEqualizer has both LP (linear phase) and MP (minimum phase) modes represented.</p>

<p>What can we take from this? Well‚Ä¶ using MFreeformAnalogEQ with a ton of bands (crazy) is not ideal. That‚Äôs about it. They all are about on par.</p>

<h4 id="phase-results-2">Phase Results</h4>

<div class="image-caption">AVA vs MFAEQ</div>

<div class="image-caption">AVA vs MFEQ</div>

<p>Once again, like we expected mostly. The MFreeformEqualizer in Minimum Phase mode with extreme mode gives is a ‚Äúnot analog-like‚Äù response, which is irrelevant really. It‚Äôs just interesting to notice.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-3">Evaluation</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs really not much of a comparison. The MFreeform series is a powerhouse of features that offers you some things you can‚Äôt really get anywhere else, including in the realm of spectral response. MFreeformEqualizer also has the <a href="#automatic-equalizer">Automatic Equalizer</a> which is not a <em>unique</em> feature, but AVA Mastering EQ does not have it.</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ has an amazingly effective and simple workflow. It‚Äôs easy to flatten out areas, find a resonance then smooth out the surrounding area or make adjustments to the entire area as necessary. The GUI is auto adjusting and defaults to allow you to make very small changes. AVA Mastering EQ also by default has an ‚Äòanalog-like‚Äô curve besides the <a href="/music/2018/05/01/Harrison-AVA-Mastering-EQ-investigation.html#further-poking---ava">Low Pass Filter</a> (which isn‚Äôt an issue with these Melda products).</p>

<p>The MFreeform series also allows you to work with the familiar point or node based workflow if you want, AVA requires that you work with a graphical EQ like system. Depending on how familiar you are with each system you may be biased. Once you ‚Äòdraw‚Äô with the MFreeform series, the point-based system becomes basically useless if you want to make changes. AVA is always easy to adjust.</p>

<p>It really comes down to how much ‚Äúpower‚Äù you need compared your particular emphasis on a straightforward workflow. They are comparable products only in the fact that they let you draw a curve with your mouse, but once you go beyond that there‚Äôs few similarities.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Personally, I really like <a href="https://www.meldaproduction.com/MFreeformEqualizer">MFreeformEqualizer</a>. I am not familiar with the releases dates of these products, but <a href="https://www.meldaproduction.com/MFreeformAnalogEq">MFreeformAnalogEQ</a> almost seems like a legacy product. I was able to get comparable results with MFreeformEqualizer in nearly every case, and better results in many cases.</p>

<p>You also get the benefit of the <a href="#automatic-equalizer">Automatic EQ</a> in MFreeformEqualizer. MFreeformAnalogEQ simply has the saturation, which is nice but it‚Äôs nothing <em>particularly</em> special.</p>

<p>Comparisons to AVA seem to be unfounded to me. The design of these products seems to target different types of users, and the UX favours different mindsets when it comes to adjusting EQ curves. You can do ‚Äúmore‚Äù with MFreeformEqualizer, but there‚Äôs a good chance it will take you longer to do simple things too.</p>

<p>Of course Melda <a href="https://www.meldaproduction.com/guides/equalizers">has a large number of other EQs</a> so it may be worth looking at what would best fit your workflow if you‚Äôre set on a Melda product.</p>

<p>At the very least you‚Äôll always get your money‚Äôs worth with a Melda product, even if you never use the core functionality ;)</p>

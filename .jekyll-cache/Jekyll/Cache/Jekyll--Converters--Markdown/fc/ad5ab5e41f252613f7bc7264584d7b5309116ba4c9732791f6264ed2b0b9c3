<p>In my <a href="/music/2018/04/15/Blue-Cat-Axiom-Plugin-Review.html">Axiom Review</a> I <a href="/music/2018/04/15/Blue-Cat-Axiom-Plugin-Review.html#presets-1">complained about the presets</a>. One of the fine fellows at Blue Cat more or less told me to “put up or shut up” in a <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=13310362&amp;postcount=29">very kind way</a>, and (s)he was totally right in doing so.</p>

<p>I didn’t actually give a good constructive summary of how to improve the presets, or how a user could create patches suited to their tracks.</p>

<p><strong>Not all of these are guitar sounds!</strong></p>

<p>So that’s what I’m doing today. I have 10 presets here for Axiom that I took from “real sessions”. I’m going to explain how to use them, how I came to the settings I used, and the tricks I use when utilizing Axiom.</p>

<p>A lot of these tips apply directly to <a href="https://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_Destructor/">Blue Cat Destructor</a> as well.</p>

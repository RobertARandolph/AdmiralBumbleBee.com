I"°<p>So I found out that you can download old versions of Studio One quite easily in your user account by clicking the â€œView Previous Versionsâ€ button right below the â€œDownload Installerâ€ button.</p>

<p>So now Iâ€™m going to run 3.2.0 unless I find out thereâ€™s a solution to the bug I was dealing with. The bug I was dealing with is as follows:</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
  <li>Start a new project</li>
  <li>Song Setup dialog</li>
  <li>Audio I/O Setup tab</li>
  <li>Double click to edit the name of an input (do not hit enter!)</li>
  <li>Press the tab key. Arrow keys or page up/down</li>
</ol>

<p>For me this instantly crashes Studio One. It is an annoying bug because I like to name my inserts per project. I may simply go back to 3.2.1 and setup a template where I name stuff with the mouse (<em>gross!</em>), but weâ€™ll see.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll keep the blog up to date with my experiences with Studio One as my month progresses.</p>

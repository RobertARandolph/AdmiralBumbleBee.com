<p>So I thought I’d try <a href="http://studioone.presonus.com/">Studio One</a> for a month, instead of my normal, and beloved, <a href="http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp">Digital Performer</a>.</p>

<p>My issue is pretty big though. I immediately tried to setup a blank document to use for fiddling around, but renaming audio i/o in the Song Setup window crashes Studio One very reliably.</p>

<p>Well, that pretty much ruins it for me.</p>

<p>Maybe they will fix it soon, then I’ll look again.</p>

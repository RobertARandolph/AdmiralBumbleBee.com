I"â$<p>I‚Äôve been asked many times about Recording/Mixing services. I only work via word-of-mouth usually, however there‚Äôs been enough demand online that I‚Äôve decided to open myself up to work from artists via the internet 2017.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the info that you need to know.</p>

<h1 id="cost">Cost</h1>

<p><strong>$100 per track per job.</strong></p>

<p><strong>5% discount</strong> for each additional track up to 30%</p>

<p><strong>5 revisions included.</strong></p>

<p>Here is a table of some costs:</p>

<h2 id="how-long-does-this-take">How long does this take?</h2>

<p>On average I can mix an electronically composed track in around 2-3 hours, with around 1 hour for revisions.</p>

<h2 id="why-so-cheap">Why so cheap?</h2>

<p>Yeah this <em>is</em> <strong>cheap</strong>. Why so cheap?</p>

<ol>
  <li>I‚Äôm primarily expecting EDM and hip-hop artists to take advantage of this. Mixing EDM is usually much less time-intensive than acoustic genres, and generally there‚Äôs a greater degree of pre-mix organization/editing to be done. Hip-hop does require more work, but I also enjoy it.</li>
  <li>This is an experiment to see if it‚Äôs more viable to cater to traditional musicians through labels at a higher rate (which results in less frequent work) or to work with modern genres of music at a lower cost (which results in more frequent work, possibly at the same income level).</li>
</ol>

<p>I <em>really</em> enjoy music and music technology if you can‚Äôt tell. I rather be working 40 hours a week at $25/hr than 20 hours a week at $50 an hour.</p>

<p>I also rather have a client list of 500+ great talents than 100 or so guys throwing together beer money to record a cover song.</p>

<h1 id="what-crazy-awesome-gear-do-you-use">What crazy awesome gear do you use?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I work in a purpose-built studio that‚Äôs been professionally designed and treated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I monitor with Adam A7 monitors with an Adam Sub10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you read my blog you‚Äôll see that I largely prefer digital workflows, and as such I am a Beta tester for a large number of DAW and plug-in developers. I have well over 1,000 (legitimate, not pirated) plug-ins with strong working knowledge of a fair portion of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do have a bunch of random ‚Äòfancy‚Äô rack gear from companies like: Eventide, Yamaha, BBE (lol?), Universal Audio, Purple Audio, Empirical Labs, Presonus and more. This is <em>constantly</em> revolving. I love to buy/sell things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have <strong>all sorts</strong> of weird guitar pedals, old mixers, early digital reverbs, spring reverbs, strange circuits I built, analog synths, guitar and bass amplifiers and more kinky audio stuff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I‚Äôve been doing this for a number of decades. I‚Äôm not only an audio engineer, but an experienced musician first. That‚Äôs the coolest gear. (and perhaps the goofiest/cringiest thing I‚Äôve written here)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p><strong>This is for repeat clients only</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What if I don‚Äôt like what you do?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Let‚Äôs talk about it. I‚Äôm a reasonable and highly self-critical person. If it seems like it‚Äôs not working out, then we‚Äôll work something out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What if you can‚Äôt mix my track?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It happens. Sometimes artists send in work that isn‚Äôt yet ready. I‚Äôll help you identify what needs to be done to further the project and get you rocking for a great release.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Are you nice?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>No. Not really. If I think something sucks, I will tell you. I am light-hearted and joke probably too much, but I‚Äôm also very blunt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What do you need from me?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Stems. Google or Youtube for how to render stems from your DAW. Talk to me first so we can discuss.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is ‚ÄúGood Organization‚Äù?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your parts are separated and clearly labelled. Any samples used are included separately. Tempo is listed. Layers are separate if applicable. Performers names are listed. Notes included such as: Hook time location and track, lyrics, style/genre references, reference track names, clearly stated goals, mix concerns, release time frame and any other information that may be pertinent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Why did you turn me down?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>I didn‚Äôt</strong>, but I will have to charge you different rates for projects that I think will require extra work or time. Anything that‚Äôs recorded with a lot of overdubs, projects 100+ tracks, anything concerning video or projects that simply need a lot of work to sound decent.</p>

        <p>This whole flat rate idea can only work if I can provide you a mix that we‚Äôre both proud of, but in a relatively short period of time. If there‚Äôs some reason that I think a single track may take me a whole day or more, then I can‚Äôt justify charging you just $100. I‚Äôm sorry.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can my label contact you?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This offer is not applicable to signed artists. Feel free to take your mixed track to go get a deal/release with a label, but I‚Äôm not dealing with labels at this rate.</p>

        <p>If you are a label, then I will have to charge you my normal <strong>hourly</strong> rates. Feel free to contact me.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How do I transfer files?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Dropbox is awesome. Zip them up and throw them on your <em>free</em> dropbox account. Don‚Äôt trust dropbox? I have a private FTP we can use.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Slow connection? Send me a flash drive in the mail.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What do I get from you?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The project file. Yes. I‚Äôll send you the entire project file. Opening it is your problem though, since you probably don‚Äôt have the same products I do. I will delete any alpha/beta products before it‚Äôs sent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A number of mixdowns: Main mix, Vocal up, Vocal Down, a cappella, karaoke, no buss compression and a quickly ‚Äòmastered‚Äô version. We can discuss any other needs you have.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How do I pay you?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Paypal. If you can‚Äôt use Paypal for some reason then we can discus your preferred option.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When do I pay you?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Payment is remitted at the end of the project. I will provide medium quality lossy-encoded mixes for preview. Upon confirmation of completion of the mix you will be invoiced. I will remit the full-quality mixes as listed above after receipt of payment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="image-caption">Audio workflow in FL</div>

<p>FLStudio does things in a way which can seem a bit strange to anyone used to another DAW, so the very first thing in a review is to cover <em>how</em> FLStudio does things.</p>

<p>FLStudioâ€™s workflow is most certainly different, but I think that youâ€™ll find that it offers a lot of flexibility thatâ€™s not present in other DAWs. The question is whether youâ€™re willing to pay for that flexibility by having to re-arrange how your brain worksâ€¦</p>

<p>Or if youâ€™re a new DAW user, thereâ€™s really no downside.</p>

<p>p.s. I forgot to mention in the announcement (Iâ€™ve edited it now) that this review is being done with a free NFR copy of FLStudio and all Image Line products.</p>

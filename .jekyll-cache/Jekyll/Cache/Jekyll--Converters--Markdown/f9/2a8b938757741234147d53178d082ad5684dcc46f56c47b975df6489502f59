I"ð<p>Iâ€™ve been playing a lot of funk, and funk inspired music on my kit lately and I really wanted a small muffling pillow for my drum.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried just shoving a pillow in there, blankets, tape, foam and all the other random things. They all muffle the drum way too much! Clearly we need a custom solution, so thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve done.</p>

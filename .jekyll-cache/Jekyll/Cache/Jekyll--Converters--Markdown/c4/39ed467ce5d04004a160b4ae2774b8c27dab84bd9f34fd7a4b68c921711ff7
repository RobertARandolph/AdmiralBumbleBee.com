<p>Itâ€™s already been over a month now and soon I will be making a decision. Will I switch from Digital Performer to Cubase? A few more posts firstâ€¦</p>

<p>Over time Iâ€™ve discovered some things about Cubase that are particularly annoying. A couple of them are nearly dealbreakers. Particularly the lack of Polar. In this post I will cover a handful of things that Iâ€™ve found to be bothersome.</p>

<h1 id="track-presetarchive-issue">Track Preset/Archive issue</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/Cubase/TrackArchive.png" alt="Just a file dialog" /></p>

<p>Cubase has the ability to have track presets, which basically allow you to save tracks and their associated settings for later recall in a different project. There are also Track Presets, which allow you to recall a track with associated plugins and other settings.</p>

<p>The issue is that when you save these, they do not retain folder information.</p>

<p>I like to save multi-track setups for instruments like drums, 5+ track guitar recordings etc.. Folders are an integral part of keeping sessions with a lot of multitracked instruments organized. Cubase simply doesnâ€™t allow this workflow.</p>

<h1 id="in-line-midi-editor-what">In-line Midi editor, what?</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/Cubase/Inline.png" alt="Inline editor fails" /></p>

<p>I love using the in-line midi editor in any program. Unfortunately, Cubaseâ€™s inline editor is fairly limited.</p>

<p>Not only can you not zoom in to the notes vertically, but you are limited in overall editor height.</p>

<p><strong>update 7/25/16</strong></p>

<p>You <em>can</em> vertically zoom in the in-line editor. There is simply no keyboard shortcut for it. Mouse-over the keys until your cursor turns in to a hand then move your cursor horizontally.</p>

<h2 id="toolbars">Toolbars?</h2>

<p>You are also missing a number of tools when using the in-line editor! How <strong>very</strong> annoying. Compare these toolbars:</p>

<h3 id="midi-editor">Midi editor</h3>

<p><a href="/assets/Cubase/MidiToolbar.png"><img src="/assets/Cubase/MidiToolbar.png" alt="Midi editor toolbar" /></a></p>

<p>Maybe these things are not particularly meaningful to you if you are not a Cubase user, but notice the difference. The missing stuff that the â€˜Key Editorâ€™ has is extremely useful and not accessible in the project window as far as I can see.</p>

<p><strong>update 7/25/16</strong></p>

<p>I goofed here too! There is a hidden toolbar for the in-place editor. You must click the triangle in the upper right, across from the track name.</p>

<h1 id="toolbar-weirdness">Toolbar weirdness?</h1>

<p>Did you notice something else about the last toolbar screenshots? The tools are draw in different orders!</p>

<p>Despite that, the same hotkeys apply. Itâ€™s quite confusing. I found it to be somewhat bothersome even when I was no longer looking at the toolbar to quick-count and hit the shortcut. Some tools I use so infrequently that I just want to flick-grab them with the mouse, but sometimes theyâ€™re not in the same order!</p>

<p>So strange.</p>

<h1 id="mono-to-stereo-or-not">Mono to stereoâ€¦ or not.</h1>

<p>Pretty simple really. Thereâ€™s no easy way to use a stereo effect on a mono track. You are forced to create a send/buss (called an FX Track) and route your track to that.</p>

<p>Quite annoying when mixing and you want to use stereo effects on a mono recording.</p>

<p>Watch at least the first video above. Basically identical to a guitar looping board. I use this type of workflow often, and while I have an <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/InfinityLoop">Infinity Looper</a>, an <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/TimeFactor">Eventide TimeFactor</a> and a heavily modified <a href="http://www.pigtronix.com/products/echolution/">Pigtronix Evolution</a>â€¦ I still prefer to work in the DAW when Iâ€™m working in the DAW.</p>

<p>Cubase has no native function, and the available VST plugins such as <a href="http://www.circularlabs.com/">Circular Labs Mobius</a> are not a good substitution.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/StudioEvaluatione/warp.gif" alt="Warp it babe!" /></p>

<p>Maybe you remember this gif from the Studio One evaluation? The ability to simply grab a beat, move it and have all the surrounding material micro-adjusted as necessary and automatically.</p>

<p>Yes, you can do this in Cubase <em>on a single track</em>. What you canâ€™t do is have this type of edit apply to grouped tracks. This is something that Studio One and Pro Tools do exceptionally well, and itâ€™s a feature that is very useful.</p>

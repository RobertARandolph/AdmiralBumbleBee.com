I"<p>The <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart</a> has been updated with new sub-categories for sample and file browsing, project navigation, live, meta, audio, automation and a lot of adjusted ratings and updated versions. “Collaboration” is a new category that’s been added as well.</p>

<p>I also made some updates to the mobile site. I know the menu is bugged still. I’m not sure how to fix it yet. I don’t browse on a mobile device so I’m not sure how I want to redesign the menu yet.</p>

<p>This was about 4 hours of work.</p>

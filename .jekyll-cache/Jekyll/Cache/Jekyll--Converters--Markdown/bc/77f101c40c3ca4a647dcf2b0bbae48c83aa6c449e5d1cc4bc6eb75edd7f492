<p>Do you have a drill press with a table? Does it have an insert? Itâ€™s square isnâ€™t it?</p>

<p>Donâ€™t be a square! Round drill press inserts allow you to have way more life out of your insert. A bonus is that you can always drill in to the same sized hole by turning the insert to the appropriate place.</p>

<p>If you are careful, one insert can last you a lifetime.</p>

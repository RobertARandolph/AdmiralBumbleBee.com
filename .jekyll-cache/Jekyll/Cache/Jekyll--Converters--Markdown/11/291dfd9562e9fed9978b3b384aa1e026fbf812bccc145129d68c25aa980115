<p>First you need to check out these articles belowâ€¦</p>

</ul>

<p><a href="/music/2018/04/23/Youre-micing-drums-wrong.html#uneven-spaced-pair-execution">In the first article I described a NO TAPE way to setup the string/cable/line</a>. This method works perfectly fine for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR3oYOAGhQE">Recorderman technique</a> and it can be useful for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GGNcGHn5BI">Glyn Johns technique</a> (even though Glyn himself doesnâ€™t mess with strings).</p>

<p>One of my readers asked me to further explain the method I use to measure drum mics without using tape on the drums. This is the response.</p>

<p>Two knots, optionally Three. Very easy, adjustable and non-destructive.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_cord">paracord</a> for this, which you <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/s/paracord?NCNI-5">can get from most home stores</a>. Please do some research and buy <a href="https://www.titansurvival.com/collections/warriorcord">some decent quality if you can</a>, itâ€™s much more pleasant to use.</p>

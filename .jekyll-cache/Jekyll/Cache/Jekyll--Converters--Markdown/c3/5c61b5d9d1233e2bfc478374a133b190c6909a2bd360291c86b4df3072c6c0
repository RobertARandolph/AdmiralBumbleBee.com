<p>Once again we’re here with a new review! I’m doing all of the Instruments and MIDI Effects in Logic Pro X. Just like the <a href="/music/2018/01/26/Cool-things-in-Logic-Pro-X-Part-10-4.html">Logic Effects review</a> I’m going to split these in to categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fantastic</strong> - These are plugins that I think would be an excellent value to purchase if possible. Likewise, they compare favourably with third-party plugins on the market.</li>
  <li><strong>Sufficient</strong> - Sufficient get the job done without much hassle. There may be no fancy extra features like some third-party competitors, or maybe the DAW version is missing some common feature, but nevertheless it’s enough to get the job done.</li>
  <li><strong>Flawed</strong> - As the name implies, these plugins have some sort of flaw. I would suggest replacing these with a third-party product.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the plugins are vectorized for clean resizing and retina screens. I’ve marked the non-vectorized models as of Logic 10.4.</p>

<p>The MIDI Effects are all excellent and will have their own section. You can assume that all of these are ‘Fantastic’.</p>

<p>There will be a total rating for everything included though, and that rating is…</p>

<p>Spoiler - Overall rating: <admrb rating="90"> </admrb></p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - I wrote this post in a different editor than I’ve been using the last ~9 months. A post is coming up on that in the future, but if you see any random ~~/j:s4k looking characters, it’s because my normal mode keychord mapping is not configured to my liking yet. But eventually it’ll be <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">good enough</a></p>

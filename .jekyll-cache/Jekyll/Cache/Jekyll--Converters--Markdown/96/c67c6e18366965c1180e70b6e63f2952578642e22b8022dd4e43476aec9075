  <div class="image-caption">An image of the new Chart!</div>

<p>If you look in the menu you will see the <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">new DAW Chart</a>. It has a host of new features and will be evolving consistently.</p>

<p>Currently itâ€™s version 0.1. Rather than sitting on it trying to perfect it I am releasing the preliminary information so that I can receive feedback and improve it.</p>

<p>Currently I also need to re-code it as well, but that will come over time as I get ideas of new features to add to it.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>

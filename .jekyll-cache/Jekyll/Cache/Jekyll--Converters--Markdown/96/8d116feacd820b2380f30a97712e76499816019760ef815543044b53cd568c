<p>The instruments of Studio One. I donâ€™t use softsynths much anymore, however I have quite a lot in the past. So letâ€™s go over my impressions of what is included in Studio One.</p>

<p>Once again weâ€™re going to use this scale, where &lt;5 means that youâ€™ll probably want to replace it and &gt;5 means itâ€™s worth using relatively frequently.</p>

<h1 id="impact-610">Impact (6/10)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/StudioEvaluatione/Impact.png" alt="Quite decent considering." /></p>

<p>Impact is a basic pad sampler. Kinda like an MPC interface. There are basic controls for pitch modulation, filter modulation and attack/hold/decay along with other sample-type things.</p>

<p>Samples can be drag&amp;dropped directly from the browser to the pads. The midi-note assignment of each pad can be changed in the lower right by typing or using the mousewheel, which is very convenient. Thereâ€™s various play modes and multiplelayers for each pad. There are 4 choke groups, which allow you to have a group of pads that can only make 1 noise at a time (think hi-hats)</p>

<p>The sample viewer window has offset/start that are not shown in the window, I found this very annoying. However, the zoom/scroll is relatively sample and effective. There are also prev/next buttons which allow you to cycle through other samples in the directory of the current sample, very useful.</p>

<p>Impact has up to 8 stereo outs, which allows for some decent mixing capabilities from a single instruments.</p>

<p>The filters are basic and sound â€˜OKâ€™. I canâ€™t say that they are very inspiring.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t worry about aliasing much since you really ought to not be pitching things particularly hard when using this as the drum-sampler it intends to be.</p>

<p>The â€˜Ueberschall Impact Drumsâ€™ sound set comes free as well. I didnâ€™t find it useful, but itâ€™s there and itâ€™s a pretty decent amount of content.</p>

<p>Functional, simple and useful.</p>

<h1 id="mai-tai-9510">Mai Tai (9.5/10)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/StudioEvaluatione/MaiTai.png" alt="Yeah, this is what I'm talking about!" /></p>

<p>This is a monster synth for something included in a DAW. It is cpu heavy, but it is circuit modelled they say. Iâ€™ll let that slide especially considering how good it sounds.</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t be going through all the features but hereâ€™s the basics: 32 voices, 2 osc, multiple filter types, 2 lfos, 2 assignable envelopes, 16 slot modulation matrix, effects section and an excellent GUI.</p>

<p>The layout of Mai Tai is excellent. Itâ€™s easy to find what you want quickly, and the controls are all of reasonable sizes. Itâ€™s easy to look at in a dark room, or a bright room, which I find relatively uncommon for GUIs of plugins. You can hide the keyboard at the bottom (thank you!), and the mod/fx section. Great additions.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no aliasing when using reasonable quality settings, however I can not see if thereâ€™s a way to have a setting automatically chosen when rendering. That would be quite useful, but it does not appear to be there.</p>

<p>The effects are great. The filters sound fantastic. I would like more Oscillator types though, but whatâ€™s there sounds great. User drawn LFOs with a good spline editor (or S1â€™s automation tools!) would be fantastic.</p>

<p>Overall, I would happily pay extra money for Mai Tai. Excellent sound, excellent GUI and totally free with S1 Pro.</p>

<h1 id="mojito-310">Mojito (3/10)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/StudioEvaluatione/Mojito.png" alt="Hard to rate this one." /></p>

<p>This isnâ€™t an awful little subtractive synth. Itâ€™s extremely basic though, and nearly every DAW comes with basically the same thing.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s just 1 osc, with 1 envelope and 1 filter type. Very basic.</p>

<p>I really doubt most folks will spend much time with Mojito unless they canâ€™t manage another instance of Mai Tai. Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s great for some simple sounds, but thereâ€™s already way better in S1 itself.</p>

<h1 id="presence-xt-810">Presence XT (8/10)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/StudioEvaluatione/Presence.png" alt="The Biggie. This is the big one guys, the big one!" /></p>

<p>The sampler. Every DAW needs to some with a proper, good sampler. (Iâ€™m looking at you MOTU!!!!!). Studio One does.</p>

<p>Presence XT is a very competent sampler that supports a wide range of sample formats and library formats. All the basics that you would expect from a decent sampler are included, and if you want to pay a bit extra you can buy <a href="https://shop.presonus.com/products/new-noteworthy/Presence-XT-Editor">the Presence XT Editor</a>. The editor allows for most of the things youâ€™d expect from a sampler like Kontakt or Halion for a minimal added cost.</p>

<p>Studio One comes with a 14gb(!!) library for Presence XT. Quite massive, and it appears that most of the sounds are quite usable.</p>

<p>Much like Mai Tai the GUI is excellent. Itâ€™s easy to find nearly everything you want, and there are quite a few things to play with.</p>

<p>The only reason I canâ€™t give Presence XT a 10/10 is that you basically have to spend $79 to use your own samples. That makes Presence XT basically just a player. For a player though, it is quite good. With the 14gb included library, support for multiple other library formats and synth-like features I think itâ€™s still an extremely useful addition. Drop the $79 and you are setup with a very good sampler for a fraction of the cost of its competitors.</p>

<p>If I was more in-the-box compositionally oriented, I feel like I would be very happy with the ability to spend $79 and have a full-featured sampler like Presence XT. The only DAW that comes close to having something like it for so little money is Logic, and nothing competes with Logicâ€™s value anyway.</p>

<h1 id="sampleone-210">SampleOne (2/10)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/StudioEvaluatione/SampleOne.png" alt="Ah, the little guy." /></p>

<p>Another basic sampler. This time, not oriented towards just drums! Similar features to Impact, but with a different UI.</p>

<p>I do wish they would update the GUI to the look of Mai Tai/Presence, but it is competent. It has the basic necessities of a sampler.</p>

<p>My biggest issue with SampleOne is the pitch-shifting algorithm sounds awful. Very audible artifacts and terrible aliasing. As such, I would probably never use it. Some folks may find some very basic use for it, but I just was unable to â€˜unhearâ€™ how awful it sounded.</p>

<p>Check out these images to see for yourself. The first image is playing the sample with no pitch shifting. The second image is the sample shifted up a half a step. Good resamplers do not add all that noise. Itâ€™s also quite audible.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-710">Conclusion (7/10)</h1>

<p>Overall, I can say that itâ€™s OK. Without Mai Tai and the Presence XT editor, I would have put this down to a 3/10 or worse.</p>

<p>Mai Tai is extremely useful, but it doesnâ€™t offer you much FM or Additive or any other fun synthy things that you may want. Presence XT as it comes is a great sample <em>player</em>, but you have to shell out money to turn it in to a proper sampler like <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-5/">Kontakt</a>.</p>

<p>It definitely seems like Presonus is upping their game with the included instruments and content, so letâ€™s hope that they add more things in Studio One 4.</p>

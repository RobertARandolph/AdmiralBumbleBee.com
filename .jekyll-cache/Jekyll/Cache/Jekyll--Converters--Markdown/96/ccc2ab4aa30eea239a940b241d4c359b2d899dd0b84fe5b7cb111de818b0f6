<div class="image-caption">Bitwig, again?!</div>

<p>I already did a <a href="/tags/#Bitwig">Bitwig review</a> didnâ€™t I? The people at <a href="https://www.bitwig.com">Bitwig</a> have been doing a lot of work and theyâ€™ve rendered a good part of my review series obsolete.</p>

<p>So what is there for a man to do except do an updated review <strong><em>and</em> make addendums to the previews reviews</strong>. The new posts will have all of the content, and Iâ€™ll silently make updates to previous content. So for the next few weeks Iâ€™ll be doing just that.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also removing the individual ratings for each plugin in the reviews. That appears to confuse people, and I understand how it can be misleading. That will be done when this post is published.</p>

<p>This time I wonâ€™t be doing <em>only</em> Bitwig content though. There will be some other content interleaved between the Bitwig posts, however Iâ€™ll be using Bitwig <em>almost</em> exclusively in this period.</p>

<p>I know announcement posts are boring, but they sometimes get folks to dm/pm/e-mail me ideas of what theyâ€™d like to see. That helps me with the review, so here it is. If you know of anything youâ€™d like to see then you can see how to contact me on my <a href="/about/">About page at the bottom</a></p>

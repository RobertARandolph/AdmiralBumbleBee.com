I"ø<p>There’s a plethora of amazing Reaper Scripts out there. Reaper offers <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascript.php">Python and Lua script capabilites</a> along with a C-based API and its own super-fast <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php">EEL</a> language.</p>

<p>There’s 100s of scripts out there that offer the user an efficiency or quality-of-life boost, but here I aim to showcase the scripts that quickly demonstrate what Reaper’s scripting environment is capable of. There’s some scripts out there that surpass anything listed, but they require a bit more time to fully appreciate their power.</p>

<p>All of these scripts are cross-platform and work equally well on macOS and Windows. <em>Most</em> of them work on Linux-based operating systems too.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - These videos are shot at 15fps to save bandwidth. The GUIs very often perform much better live.</p>

<p>Envelope-based compressor is a compressor that applies the amplitude changes to the track’s envelope. This allows you to have a compressor that’s freely editable on a timeline.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever struggled trying to get vocal compression <em>just</em> right by fooling with a series of compressors and automation, then Envelope-based compressor is a godsend.</p>

<p>When using stretch markers naively, the transient is stretched as much as the rest of the sound. For things like percussion it’s important that the impact of the sound be retained, and stretch marker guard allows you to do this will still warping your hits in to place.</p>

<p>Stretch marker guard easily allows you to place new stretch markers around the existing markers, either before, after or both. This makes it so that when stretching, the transient is guarded from an extreme stretch. Since stretch markers only affect the area between markers, the transient is given its own small area where minimum stretch occurs, and then the rest of the movement ideally happens during the sustain of the sound.</p>

<p>This is an <em>exceptionally</em> useful tool and can make a huge difference in the impact and fidelity of your drum sounds.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to quantize your stretch markers to midi? Midi to envelope points? Item starts to midi? How about any combination of those <em>and much more</em></p>

<p>You can quantize Items, Stretch Markers, Envelope points and Midi Notes to: Items, Stretch Markers, Envelope points, Notes, Grooves, Grid, and swing grid. All of these with a wide range of options and a %-based-amount to tweak the result to perfection.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and it all happens live as you change parameters!</p>

<p>Articulations are ways of varying performance attributes when using large and complex multi-sample libraries, often Orchestral libraries. Articulations are usually triggered via keyswitches (and the terms are often used interchangeably). Keyswitches are <em>usually</em> specific midi notes, that exist outside the range of the instrument, that are used to change the current performance characteristics of the instrument. Keyswitches can also be CC or program change as well.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, managing this data can be problematic, and very few DAWs have solutions to this problem. Enter Reaticulate.</p>

<p>Reaticulate gives you a simple GUI for managing articulation data in your MIDI based performances. I suggest watching the video above to get a better idea of what Reaticulate offers. If you are someone that often uses large orchestral libraries then I think you will be very pleased.</p>

<p>Guitars are peculiar instruments in that the chord forms differ greatly from the piano that most of us use to input MIDI. A big part of creating authentic sounding guitar parts is getting the chord shapes correct.</p>

<p>Enter MIDI Guitar Chord Tool. It allows you to quickly enter common guitar chord voicings, inversions <em>and</em> add strumming.</p>

<p>It’s not just for guitar either. It works fantastic for creating thick synth chords or a beginning for various forms of composition.</p>

<p>Layering items for creating sound effects or more powerful musical samples is a common task these days. Often a designer will want to create a variance of items to create interest and have an arsenal of sounds to use later.</p>

<p>ExtremRaym’s shuffle items scrips let you do this. You set your snap offsets for the layers, laid across tracks, then you can shuffle the layers around to create new variations. Very useful.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can simply shift around each <em>column</em>. This allows you to move around layers, but maintain the same layer composition.</p>

<p>RS5K Manager is an integrated browser and step sequencer for using Reaper’s SamplOmatic5000. It allows you to store directories for quick recall, quickly map samples to new instances of SamplOmatic5000 on the selected track while set to the assigned note.</p>

<p>From there it includes a simple step sequencer for writing midi to the currently selected item, or optionally the ability to drop in references to the current sample as an audio item on a child track.</p>

<p>RS5K manager isn’t exactly a powerhouse, but it is a great shortcut to getting started on a track. It’s also another awesome example of what can be done with ReaScripts.</p>

<p>Veto_gfxanalyzer is a multi-channel analyzer. You can route multiple tracks to it and the spectrum of the tracks are overlaid.</p>

<p>Use is simple after installation. You insert Veto_gfxanalyzer.jsfx on a track. Route the tracks you want to that track with the routings of 1/2-&gt;1/2, 1/2-&gt;3/4, 1/2-&gt;5/6 etc… incrementing the destination channel each time. This means you’re sending audio to a different channel on the same track, and gfxanalyzer reads those channels.</p>

<p>You can also assign the track colours to the analyzer output by selecting the Veto_gfxanalyzer window and running the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Script: Set colors of focused Veto_gfxanalyzer to tracks sending on channels 1-16.eel</code> script.</p>

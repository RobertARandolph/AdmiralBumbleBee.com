<p>Recently <a href="http://sonimus.com/products/StonEQ4k/">Sonimus released StonEQ 4K</a> which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_State_Logic#4000_series">SSL 4k series</a> EQ emulation.</p>

<p><strong>I bought it.</strong></p>

<p>If you read <a href="/music/2017/11/21/What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ.html">my most recent post about what I want in an EQ</a>, you might be confused. Why did I purchase an EQ that has only <a href="/music/2017/11/21/What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ.html#what-i-do-not-want">what I do not want</a> and none of the <a href="/music/2017/11/21/What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ.html#what-i-want">features that I do want</a>?</p>

<p><strong>WARNING! THIS MAY MAKE YOU SICK TO YOUR STOMACH!</strong></p>

  <img src="/assets/SonimusEQ/GUI.jpg" alt="The original GUI">
  <div class="image-caption">The original EQ</div>

<p>Does this make you nauseous? It make me nauseous. The GUI is rendered as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">perspective projection</a>.</p>

<p>No matter which direction, or which lighting you look at this image at, your brain is tricked. If you stare at the image, like many of us do, for a period of time then look away you may suddenly feel dizzy or nauseous because of the perspective cues that don’t make sense.</p>

<p>I’m not looking “down” at my computer screen. I don’t have lights in the upper right. I don’t get <em>that close</em> to an EQ when I use it. Worst of all, the perspective doesn’t change when you move positions.</p>

<p>This isn’t an uncommon thing. A number of developers use perspective rendering. People like me have issues with it though.</p>

<p>Recently sonimus released this product and they <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/new-product-alert/1187003-sonimus-releases-stoneq-4k-satson-series-equalizer.html">were met with a lot of criticism about this rendering</a>.</p>

<p>The timeline…</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Within 1 week of the initial criticism</em> Diego at sonimus <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12953336-post43.html">posts 3 new options</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone prefers C, but it’s still not right.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Diego posts 2 <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12953403-post50.html">new options</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone prefers D, but it’s <em>still</em> not right.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>RMorgan chimes in and <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12953742-post60.html">mentions using a simple</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection">orthographic render</a></li>
  <li>Diego <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12956298-post85.html">offers an orthographic projection</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Universally liked!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Within 2 weeks of the original launch <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12972178-post137.html">the new GUI is public</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While the new GUI still has some visual cues that are practically nonsensical, they are at least consistent. This resolves the seasickness issue for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://sonimus.com/products/">Sonimus</a> responded to criticism in the best possible way. They took time to understand the people with an issue, offered options, <em>took more time to understand the response to those options</em>!, and responded further.</p>

<p>The ultimate result being that they have earned themselves a fan.</p>

<p>And you know what? <a href="http://sonimus.com/products/StonEQ4k/">StonEQ 4k</a> is pretty damn good.</p>

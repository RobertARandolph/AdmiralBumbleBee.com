<p>Iâ€™ve been doing a number of <a href="/tags/#Live+Stream">Live Streams</a> making some leather strops, and now they are <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/AdmiralBumbleBee">for sale on my Etsy store! along with some cool wood combs</a>.</p>

<p>Parts 4 and 5 of the streams are linked after the break as well. So check those out if youâ€™re curious.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/AdmiralBumbleBee">My etsy shop</a> will be linked in my nav bar up top soon, but for now this is the announcement.</p>

<p><strong>BUY BUY BUY BUY</strong></p>

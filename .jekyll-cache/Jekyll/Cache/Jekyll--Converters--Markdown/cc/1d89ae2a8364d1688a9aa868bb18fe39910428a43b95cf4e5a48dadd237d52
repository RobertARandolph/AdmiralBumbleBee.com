<p>My wife has a neck injury for which she uses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/resistance-bands-fitness-bands/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3407931">resistance bands</a> in her therapy regimen.</p>

<p>The rub is that the bands need to be held at certain positions, in various ways, so that she can pull on them. Our house is basically a labyrinth of workshops, we donâ€™t even have a living room. Weâ€™re both artsy/crafty folk that donâ€™t have much of an interest in a â€œnormalâ€ house. The result is that thereâ€™s only one place in the house where she can spread her arms out.</p>

<p>That place also happens to be the main walkway in the house. Which means I donâ€™t want things on the wall where Iâ€™ll inevitably run in to them and destroy it, or me.</p>

<p>My solution was to build a portable resistance band holding station that can be clamped on the wall.</p>

<p>Luckily, this also buys me some time for my next review thatâ€™s coming up later this week. Itâ€™s taking me some extra time so consider this post my ninja-kung-fu redirection while I finish it.</p>

<p>On with it!</p>

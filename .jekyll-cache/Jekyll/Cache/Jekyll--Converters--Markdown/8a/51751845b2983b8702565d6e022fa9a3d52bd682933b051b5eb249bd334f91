<p>Harrison recently <a href="https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/ava-plugins.html">Released the AVA Mastering EQ</a>. I <a href="/music/2017/09/30/Review-of-Mixbus-effect-plugins.html##xt-me-mastering-equalizer">already reviewed its Mixbus cousin</a> and quite frankly I didn‚Äôt think too highly of it based on the asking price.</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ is a VST/AU/AAX version of XT-ME at a <strong>far</strong> more reasonable price of $49 (on May 1st, 2018). I suggest simply taking this price in to consideration as I explore this product.</p>

<p>This is not a review per se. This is my curiosity being documented. I‚Äôm just going to explore the product and take you along for the ride. If you think my findings are evidence of a purchase worth $29 then go for it.</p>

<p>I was given this plugin for beta testing, and I talk with a number of employees at Harrison frequently now. I‚Äôm <em>fairly</em> certain that my personal views on this product are tainted by my relationship with their team at this point. So I‚Äôm going to avoid giving a final recommendation of any sort. Keep in mind that my exploration may be similarly influenced‚Ä¶ or not. You decide.</p>

<h1 id="phase-and-frequency">Phase and Frequency</h1>

<p>I will be using <a href="https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-q-2-equalizer-plug-in">Fabfilter Pro-Q 2</a> as the control for these tests. I‚Äôm attempting to match the frequency response between Pro-Q 2 and AVA Mastering EQ. Then we‚Äôll explore the <a href="/music/2017/09/25/Harrison-Mixbus-EQ-Revisited.html">phase response</a>.</p>

<h2 id="test-1---flat-top">Test 1 - Flat Top</h2>

<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>

<img src="/assets/AVA/AVAtest1.png" alt="Ava Test 1">
<div class="image-caption">Ava Test 1</div>

<img src="/assets/AVA/ProQtest1.png" alt="Pro Q Test 1">
<div class="image-caption">Pro Q Test 1</div>

<p>These are the settings used for the first test.</p>

<p>Pro Q has a single 12 pole filter engaged.</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ has 8 bands engaged. <strong>EDIT</strong> - I‚Äôve been corrected. ALL bands are always engaged. There‚Äôs simply 8 visible bands active on the GUI in this case.</p>

<p>I had to manually tweak this to get them close to each other. The actual settings are not useful, and I did not record their exact values for this test.</p>

<p>The AVA Mastering EQ setup is not <em>perfect</em> because it‚Äôs somewhat difficult to get it perfect, but that‚Äôs irrelevant in normal usage.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Curve1.png" alt="Curve 1">
<div class="image-caption">Curve 1</div>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Phase1.png" alt="Phase 1">
<div class="image-caption">Phase 1</div>

<p>As we can see the frequency response <em>and</em> the phase response are identical.</p>

<p>This is expected, but contrary to some <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=13288294&amp;postcount=42">information a Harrison rep posted online</a>. It‚Äôs to be noted that he was using the wrong tools to match the shapes though.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt at all think the poster was being dishonest. I suspect most users would attempt to do this the same way that Ben did. It‚Äôs just possible to get much closer than indicated, if you feel that this is a necessary task you encounter in your daily work.</p>

<h2 id="test-2---single-band">Test 2 - Single Band</h2>

<h3 id="settings-1">Settings</h3>

<img src="/assets/AVA/AVAtest2.png" alt="Ava Test 2">
<div class="image-caption">Ava Test 2</div>

<img src="/assets/AVA/ProQtest2.png" alt="Pro Q Test 2">
<div class="image-caption">Pro Q Test 2</div>

<p>This time we‚Äôre using a single band in AVA Mastering EQ set to +4db at 1khz.</p>

<p>Pro-Q 2 is using a 4-pole filter with approximately a Q-factor of 4.5 centered at 1khz.</p>

<h3 id="results-1">Results</h3>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Curve2.png" alt="Curve 2">
<div class="image-caption">Curve 2</div>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Phase2.png" alt="Phase 2">
<div class="image-caption">Phase 2</div>

<p>The frequency response of Pro-Q is slightly wider. This makes me think that the slope of the AVA Mastering EQ filters are about 18db/oct, since the 12db/oct setting in Pro-Q is too narrow to match.</p>

<p>The phase response is once again very similar.</p>

<p>I suspect that by using 3 12db/oct bands in Pro-Q 2 and some tweaking, I could have matched the frequency response‚Ä¶ but resulting phase response would have been awful.</p>

<h2 id="test-3---highlow-pass">Test 3 - High/Low pass</h2>

<h3 id="settings-2">Settings</h3>

<img src="/assets/AVA/AVAtest3.png" alt="Ava Test 3">
<div class="image-caption">Ava Test 3</div>

<img src="/assets/AVA/ProQtest3.png" alt="Pro Q Test 3">
<div class="image-caption">Pro Q Test 3</div>

<p>Both products have a 12db/oct high-pass at 100hz, and a 12db/oct low-pass at 10,000hz.</p>

<p>Settings were left matched.</p>

<p>Pro-Q 2 has a ‚ÄòNatural Phase‚Äô mode. This helps <a href="/music/2017/11/21/What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ.html#cramping">compensated for the filter-craziness near nyquist</a>. I suspect that Pro-Q is getting a natural phase response with normal IIR filters, then adjusting the frequency response with a linear-phase high shelf. The net result being ‚Äòanalog-like‚Äô frequency <em>and</em> phase response.</p>

<h3 id="results-2">Results</h3>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Curve3.png" alt="Curve 3">
<div class="image-caption">Curve 3</div>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Phase3.png" alt="Phase 3">
<div class="image-caption">Phase 3</div>

<p>We have differences!</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ is slightly more aggressive in the low-pass frequency response.</p>

<p>The notable thing here is that AVA Mastering EQ has a surprisingly flat phase response in the high-end. Note that Pro-Q‚Äôs phase response ends at about 45¬∞ and AVA Mastering EQ ends at 0¬∞ phase rotation.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dig further!</p>

<h2 id="test-4---higher-high-pass">Test 4 - Higher High-pass</h2>

<h3 id="settings-3">Settings</h3>

<div class="image-caption">Pro Q Test 4</div>

<p>This time I‚Äôm using a low-pass set at 15khz on both products. No low-pass.</p>

<h3 id="results-3">Results</h3>

<p>Oh no. Here it is again. The filter is cramping near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">the nyquist limit</a>.</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ‚Äôs low-pass filter gets steeper and steeper the closer you get to nyquist (half of the sample rate).</p>

<p>The red line is the first setting at 5khz. It moves down from there predictably. (Red-&gt;Green-&gt;Blue-&gt;Purple etc..)</p>

<p>Here we can see a 12db/oct low-pass frequency sweep in Pro-Q. Note how the filter‚Äôs shape remains fairly consistent.</p>

<p>And an image of the phase response.</p>

<h3 id="even-more-poking---ava-impulse-response">Even More Poking - AVA impulse response</h3>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Impulse.png" alt="Impulse Response">
<div class="image-caption">Impulse response</div>

<p>Impulse response is what the filter does in response to a single sample spike. This is basically how you can see ‚Äúringing‚Äù of filters, including pre-rining.</p>

<p><em>Pretty big</em> difference here. AVA Mastering EQ is -20db quieter at some points.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it Mean?!</h3>

<p>I said this ain‚Äôt a review. It‚Äôs up to you to try the demo and listen.</p>

<p>Pro-Q is definitely closer to an ‚Äòanalog-like‚Äô response. Is that necessarily the best outcome though?</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ cuts the high end more aggressively, which I‚Äôve seen some people claim is desirable in the digital realm.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs your choice‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôve read my website, then you know what I think about this situation.</p>

<h2 id="test-5---weird-curve">Test 5 - Weird Curve</h2>

<div class="image-caption">Pro Q Test 5</div>

<p>I took an old project and applied a very light EQ to it using AVA Mastering EQ. I then matched this in Pro-Q.</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ has 8 bands active. <strong>EDIT</strong> - I‚Äôve been corrected. ALL bands are always engaged. There‚Äôs simply 8 visible bands active on the GUI in this case.</p>

<p>Pro-Q has 2.</p>

<p>It took me about 20 minutes to match these two. It was <em>FAR</em> easier to using AVA Mastering EQ to match with, since it‚Äôs <a href="#usage">easier to create gentle curves</a></p>

<h3 id="results-4">Results</h3>

<p>I couldn‚Äôt get the frequency response perfect, but it‚Äôs close.</p>

<p>Phase response is equally similar. No surprises here.</p>

<h2 id="test-6---distortion-and-noise">Test 6 - Distortion and noise</h2>

<img src="/assets/AVA/Distortion.png" alt="THD">
<div class="image-caption">THD</div>

<p>All processors add a bit of distortion to the signal.</p>

<p>I have a number of graphs, but they are all fairly consistent with the results shown above. They‚Äôre both below 0.005% THD.</p>

<p>They both have similar noise floors. AVA Mastering EQ was slightly lower in high frequency noise and higher in low-frequency noise (similar to the THD graph) I was unable to capture an overlaid graph because my analyzer is being a bit of twa‚Ä¶ jerk.</p>

<h1 id="interface">Interface</h1>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">
<source src="/assets/AVA/AVASwipe.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<div class="video-caption">Swiper! No Swiping!</div>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ is essentially an intelligent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio)#Graphic_equalizer">graphic equalizer</a>.</p>

<p>You draw the curve you want and it adapts. Unlike traditional graphic EQs though, what you see is <em>mostly</em> what you get (<a href="#phase-and-frequency">as evidenced above</a>).</p>

<p>So you can gently create complex EQ curves without needing to adjust a number of frequency/gain/Q knobs, or needing to click and drag multiple nodes. Single bands can be reset with right click or right click and drag.</p>

<p><em>THERE IS A TRIM OPTION</em>. A frequent reader <a href="/music/2017/11/01/Gainstaging-for-the-modern-musician.html">will know why I think this is so important</a>. Every plugin needs this.</p>

<h2 id="smooth">Smooth</h2>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">
<source src="/assets/AVA/Smooth.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<div class="video-caption">Smoothing</div>

<p>The created curves can be smoothed by holding shift and dragging. The discontinuities in the curve are lessened and the response is made to be more ‚Äògentle‚Äô</p>

<p>This is a significant shortcut over manipulating multiple EQ bands via node or knob. The time it takes to create a curve, then make it gentler is vastly reduced compared to more traditional digital EQ workflows.</p>

<h2 id="zoom">Zoom</h2>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">
<source src="/assets/AVA/Zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<div class="video-caption">Zoom Zoom.</div>

<p>The response graph defaults to being zoomed to a -4 to +4 range. As you create bands that have higher or lower gain, the graph automatically adjusts. It goes up to -14 to +14.</p>

<p>An upcoming feature is the ability to lock the zoom, as well as manually set the zoom feature. That is showcased in the video above.</p>

<p>The -4 to +4 mode plus the <a href="#resize">resizing capability</a> allows for some <em>very</em> fine movements.</p>

<h2 id="resize">Resize</h2>

<source src="/assets/AVA/Resize.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<div class="video-caption">Resizing</div>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ is <em>fully</em> resizable. It can be resized from a fullscreen monster to be placed on a second monitor or down to an ultra-tiny space-saving indicator of what‚Äôs on your master channel.</p>

<h1 id="price">Price</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.fabfilter.com/shop/?currency=usd&amp;vat=0">Fabfilter Pro-Q 2</a> - <strong>$179usd</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/ava-plugins.html">AVA Mastering EQ</a> - <strong>$49usd</strong></p>

<h1 id="cpu">CPU</h1>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ is slightly heavier on CPU than Pro-Q by a factor of about 2 when there‚Äôs an equal number of ‚Äúvisible bands‚Äù active. Still very light.</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ has all bands always active, so there‚Äôs no change in CPU usage as you adjust bands.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>No conclusion. Read above. <a href="https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/ava-plugins.html">Try the demo</a>. That‚Äôs it.</p>

<p>Well, no, that‚Äôs not it. AVA Mastering EQ does let you do some things much faster than other ‚ÄòNode and Knob‚Äô type EQs. The workflow is a notably unique aspect of it. While doing these fairly basic tests, it was always easier for me to create a curve in Pro-q, then match it with AVA. If I made it in AVA first then it was a total pain to match Pro-Q.</p>

<p>A large part of the ‚Äòsound‚Äô of a plugin isn‚Äôt in the DSP, it‚Äôs in the GUI. Allowing the user to quickly access the ideas they want to express without overshooting or interfering with it is where ‚Äògood sound‚Äô is born.</p>

<p>Obviously Pro-Q 2 has <em>far</em> more features, and this was my qualm <a href="/music/2017/09/30/Review-of-Mixbus-effect-plugins.html#xt-me">when I did the original review of XT-ME</a>. For $109 (even though it was constantly on sale), XT-ME didn‚Äôt provide anything that was <em>particularly</em> amazing.</p>

<p>For $49 though‚Ä¶ I think you can make your own decision.</p>

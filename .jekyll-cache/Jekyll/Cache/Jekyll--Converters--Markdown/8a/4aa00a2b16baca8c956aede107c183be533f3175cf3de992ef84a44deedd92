<p>A while ago I <a href="/music/2017/02/11/Drumstick-modification.html">wrote a post about modifying your drumsticks</a> to help them last longer. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpEfTfyw6G4">I also have a video on the topic using another method</a> that <em>any</em> drummer can execute, even on store-bought sticks without any tools.</p>

<p>It really will make your drumsticks last longer, sound better and get you all the ladies (guys).</p>

<p>Let me show you the results and benefits of the modification.</p>

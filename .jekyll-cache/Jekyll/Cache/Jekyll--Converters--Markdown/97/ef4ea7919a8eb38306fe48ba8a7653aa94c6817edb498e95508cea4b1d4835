<p>It’s shop maintenance day. Where I align fences, wax tables and tighten bolts.</p>

<p>As part of that, I go through and also tune up all my planes, including the 20”(51cm) jointer plane that I made. It’s all tuned up now and taking wispy, thin, gossamer shavings. Hard maple is the wood, and the blade is A2 steel.</p>

<p>Yep, I‚Äôve been gone for about 1 month. I was working hard on a big post about‚Ä¶ something which I‚Äôll write about later. In the meantime, since I do not have running water in the shop I made a little wall-hanging sharpening station. It‚Äôs already quite dirty from use, and it works fantastic!</p>

<p>The whole thing is made of white pine 2‚Äùx4‚Äù, 18mm birch plywood and the following parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Orbit-1-2-in-MNPT-x-1-2-in-Barb-Elbow-94359/206638395">1/2‚Äù female pipe thread to 1/2‚Äù barb</a>. Note the shape, the low-profile is very important. Big thanks to my wife for finding this piece! It was a pain in the ass to figure out how to get this put together and locate that specific part until she stepped in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-4-in-O-D-x-1-2-in-I-D-x-10-ft-PVC-Clear-Vinyl-Tube-769299/207144355">3/4‚Äù OD x 1/2‚Äù ID vinyl hose</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013JPXNLA/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Submersible fountain pump</a>. Note that the tubing and 1/2‚Äù adapter that you purchase must be compatible with the pump you choose. The pump that I purchased is a bit too powerful, but oh well!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R9OFGS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Loc-Line Coolant Hose</a>. <em>DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND BUY OFF BRAND</em>. I made this mistake. Loc-line is superior!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How you build the basin and cabinet is up to you. I have it finished in 5 coats of water-based polyurethane, waxed then sealed with 100% silicone sealant. The basin is totally water tight.</p>

<p>How it works is simple. The pump pumps water from a bucket up to some vinyl pipe that‚Äôs hidden in a channel behind the cabinet. The basin has vinyl tubing going back to the bucket. The pump is placed on the side of the bucket to minimize sediment pickup, and I will be adding a filter for the drain hose.</p>

<p>I used a footswitch (barely seen in the lower right) to activate the pump, and there‚Äôs <a href="http://www.inspiredled.com">LED strip lighting</a> (I pulled a piece so you can see it) under the shelf for lighting.</p>

<p>If someone needs the plans, I can put it together in sketchup. I do think that if you‚Äôre capable of building it, you should be capable of designing something that works for your situation though!</p>

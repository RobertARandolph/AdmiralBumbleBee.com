<p>First thing my wife said was â€œWow, these look legit.â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™m reviewing the <a href="https://www.kaliaudio.com/lone-pine-detail">Kali Audio LP-8 Studio Monitors</a> today.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t think they looked legit personally. I thought they were just your standard cheap studio monitors. They donâ€™t have that intimidating heft when you take them out of the box, or the firmness on the baffle.</p>

<p>My disclaimer about paying for the product is at the end of the review this time.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s see how they stand up!</p>

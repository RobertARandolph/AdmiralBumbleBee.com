<p>Today I’m going to take some time to talk about something that happened in a <a href="https://www.woodcraft.com">Woodcraft</a>.</p>

<p>This will apply to nearly anything in life where you create. Music, programming, woodworking, sewing, gardening… basically anything.</p>

<p>I’ll also be covering a music-mixing topic.</p>

<p>I’m writing this post because I want to test out using Dragon for Mac I have been having RSI issues lately and I need to find an alternative to typing on my keyboard. (Note: I actually abandoned this after a paragraph. Not for me.)</p>

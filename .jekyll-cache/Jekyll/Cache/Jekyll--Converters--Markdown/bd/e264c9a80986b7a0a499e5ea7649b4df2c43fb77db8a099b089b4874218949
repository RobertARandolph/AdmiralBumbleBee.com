I""<p>The <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Feature Chart</a> has been updated yet again with a Live Performance section.</p>

<p>Many of the features necessary for live performance are covered already, like stability, but I’ve added a few ratings that focus on the <em>ease</em> and power of certain features.</p>

<p>The default weight is 0. I have the default set as it matters to me, and currently I do not do live performance.</p>

<p>I’ve also changed the default weights since my <a href="/general/2018/06/09/Lets-talk-about-me-and-my-future.html">recent focus has changed a bit</a>. I changed ratings for <a href="/tags/#Bitwig">Bitwig</a> and <a href="/tags/#Waveform">Waveform</a>. The Bitwig ratings will be changing even more soon… for reasons you’ll find out in a bit over a week ;)</p>

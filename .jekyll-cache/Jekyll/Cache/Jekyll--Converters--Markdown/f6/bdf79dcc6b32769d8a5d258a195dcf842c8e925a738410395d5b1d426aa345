<p>I recently had an opportunity to interview one of the Software Developers and UX designers at Steinberg.</p>

<p>Often it is easy to forget that the people behind the software use are real people that are excited about working on the software and are <em>truly</em> trying to put out the best product they can under the circumstances of time and resources.</p>

<p>So this is just a short interview with one of the fantastic people working there.</p>

<p>(Iâ€™m not Steinberg biased, every company has similar people. This is simply the company that I choose).</p>

<p><a href="/music/2018/04/23/Youre-micing-drums-wrong.html">In Part One of this series</a> I discussed placement of microphones. Microphone placement is very important with regards to tonality and time/phase coherence. When using two microphones for a stereo array, distance is also an important factor with regards to amplitude.</p>

<p>There’s a missing piece of the puzzle though: Microphone pickup patterns. So in this post I’m going to discuss various drum miking systems, their deficiencies and how to approach correcting them if necessary.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate once again, since many people seemed to miss it, <strong>I am not claiming that any specific system of drum miking is wrong</strong>. My claim is that if you are making decisions about microphone placement without being aware of the tradeoffs of each system, then you’re doing it wrong.</p>

<p>However I do strongly believe that there are systems that can be used with minimal tradeoffs (and likewise minimal artistic benefits).</p>

<p>Anyway…</p>

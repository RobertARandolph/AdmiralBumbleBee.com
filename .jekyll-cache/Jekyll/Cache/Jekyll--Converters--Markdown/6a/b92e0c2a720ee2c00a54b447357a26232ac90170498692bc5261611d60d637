I".<p>Nothing fancy here, but <a href="https://www.patreon.com/AdmiralBumbleBee">I’ve setup a Patreon</a> since I’ve been asked about it so many times.</p>

<p>I’ll be keeping the Patreon page up-to-date and pursuing this idea. Nothing else on the site will change, except possibly more content when Patreon goals are met.</p>

<p><a href="/DonateNow/">The paypal donation</a> is still live as well. You can just click the DONATE! link in the upper right to get both options.</p>

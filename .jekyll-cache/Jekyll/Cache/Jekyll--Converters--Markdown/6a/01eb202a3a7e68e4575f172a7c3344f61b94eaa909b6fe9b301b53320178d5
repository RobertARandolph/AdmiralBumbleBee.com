I"„3<p>I love my Bosch 4100 table saw. The gravity rise stand is amazing, it‚Äôs compact, it‚Äôs accurate, it‚Äôs well-made.</p>

<p>The issue is that with how compact it is, you need some sort of extension wings to <em>safely</em> support your work as you cut it.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/TablesOut.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/TablesOut.jpg" alt="Done" /></a></p>

<p>Like most people you could simply buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1002-Outfeed-Support-Extension/dp/B00004R5S0/">TS1002 Outfeed Support Extension</a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1016-Outfeed-Support-Assembly/dp/B0105D9LRY/">TS1016 Outfeed Support Assembly</a> for outfeed support. You‚Äôll also need a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1003-Table-Support-Extension/dp/B00004R5S2/">TS1003 Left Side Support Table</a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1008-Left-Support-Table/dp/B0105D9ME6/">TS1008 Left Side Support Table</a> for left side support.</p>

<p>Those damn things are too expensive, and we‚Äôre workshop men! <strong>We can make our own things.</strong> Let me show you how I made mine</p>

<h1 id="prep-work">Prep-work</h1>

<p>We don‚Äôt want the conduit hangers‚Äô screw end to be grabbing the threads. We want the nylon lock washer to be applying the tension alone. So drill out the thread-end of your conduit hangers with a 1.21875‚Äù (9/32) drill bit. Anything that lets your 0.25‚Äù-20 bolts run through is fine.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/DrillConduit.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/DrillConduit.jpg" alt="Like a hotdog down a hallway" /></a></p>

<p>Next thing you need to do, if you bought/have the UHMW tape, is to apply it to the inside of the conduit hangers. Just like in the photos.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/ConduitUHMW1.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/ConduitUHMW1.jpg" alt="Slippery" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/ConduitUHMW2.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/ConduitUHMW2.jpg" alt="Smooth" /></a></p>

<p>This allows your conduit to slide easily through the hangers. It makes for a rather pleasant experience when pulling the supports out.</p>

<p>You also need to center drill a hole in 1 end of the conduit to attach it to the support later. I simply drilled a 0.75‚Äù hole in a piece of scrap ply wood and drilled it as you can see. You want the hole centered and about 0.375‚Äù from the edge of the conduit.</p>

<h1 id="cut-scene-1">Cut scene 1</h1>

<p>Cut your conduit down so you have the following pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Left side support - 15.75‚Äù</li>
  <li>Left side support - 15.75‚Äù</li>
  <li>Outfeed extension support - 20.75‚Äù</li>
  <li>Outfeed extension support - 20.75‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>BE CAREFUL</em></strong> The burrs on the cut end will destroy your beautiful modeling hands. Deburr them with a file or sandpaper on the inside and the outside.</p>

<p>Remove any stickers with some mineral spirits, then <em>lightly</em> sand with #320 sandpaper or light-grey Scotchbrite. Lubricate it. That means not WD-40. Use an actual oil or preferably a dry lubricant.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="attaching-the-conduit-on-the-left-side">Attaching the conduit on the left side</h1>

<p>Start off by screwing the conduit in to the left sides_ using the M6x12mm bolts.</p>

<p>Start with the conduit hangers rotated 90¬∞ from their final position, tighten them as much as you can without stripping the screw. Now use a pair of pliers to turn them 90¬∞ to their final position.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/Tighten1.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/Tighten1.jpg" alt="Starting..." /></a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/Tighten2.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/Tighten2.jpg" alt="Tighten with a driver" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/Tighten3.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/Tighten3.jpg" alt="Bring it home with the metal gripper thingy guys" /></a></p>

<p>The left side is easy. The right side is a pain.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="attaching-the-conduit-on-the-right-side">Attaching the conduit on the right side</h1>

<p>Make sure your bolts are in first! Good luck. This is a pain.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="tightening-the-conduit-hangers">Tightening the conduit hangers</h1>

<p>Slide the conduit in carefully. You can easily rip up your UHMW tape the first by catching it with the edge of the conduit if it‚Äôs not very well deburred. Remember that for the outfeed extension we are using the 20.75‚Äù conduit.</p>

<p>The left side outfeed extension conduit hangers are easy to do. If you are using the standard 1.5‚Äù bolts that came with the hangers..</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt do this:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/Dont.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/Dont.jpg" alt="You figure this out the hardway the first time" /></a></p>

<p>Do this instead‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/Do.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/Do.jpg" alt="Ahh, much better." /></a></p>

<p><em>Or you can just grab some ¬º-20 1‚Äù bolts from around the shop and not be an idiot like I was.</em></p>

<p>The right-side is a bit more fiddly. With hex-head bolts it‚Äôs still fiddly but at least you can use a wrench instead of pliers.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/TightenHard.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/TightenHard.jpg" alt="This sucked." /></a></p>

<p>Eventually it will be nice and smooth and pretty and‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/ConduitIn.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/ConduitIn.jpg" alt="Hmmm better." /></a></p>

<hr />

<h1 id="the-support-bit---drilling">The support bit - Drilling</h1>

<p>First cut your plywood to size lengthwise. <strong>Leave extra height for now</strong>. It‚Äôs up to you how wide to make it. My outfeed is exactly 29-1/16‚Äù wide.</p>

<p>Measure the location of the conduit sticking out and drill a 0.75‚Äù hole at 0.375‚Äù from the edge. I measured it by setting the plywood on the conduit, using a combination square to outline both sides of the conduit, then finding the center of those 2 points.</p>

<p>This needs to be fairly exact or your support will be difficult to pull out or push in because of the Y shaped warping that will be caused by not having the holes in the correct place.</p>

<p>You can leave the hole round, but I chopped it down to a U shape.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/Support1.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/Support1.jpg" alt="Not too bad." /></a></p>

<hr />

<h1 id="the-support-bit---cutting">The support bit - Cutting</h1>

<p>You need to attach the conduit to the support the same way you will in the final assembly. I just used some Spax 1.5‚Äù screws.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/AttachConduit1.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/AttachConduit1.jpg" alt="Left side attachment" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/AttachConduit2.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/AttachConduit2.jpg" alt="Right side attachment" /></a></p>

<p>Now insert your support posts. Hehehe.</p>

<p>I simply marked the required cutline for the height using a chisel.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/Mark.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/Mark.jpg" alt="Mark the height" /></a></p>

<p>I would tell you how tall my piece is, but I don‚Äôt want anyone taking shortcuts. Where you drill the holes for the conduit will change everything. This is easy enough to do!</p>

<p><strong>First cut the height with a normal 90¬∞-bevel rip cut.</strong></p>

<p>Then you need to cut a 45¬∞ nearly to the top, but not all the way. Sneak up on it. You want there to be a little flat on the top.</p>

<p>Successfully done, it will look like this.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/PostCut.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/PostCut.jpg" alt="After the deed" /></a></p>

<p>That‚Äôs it. <strong>You‚Äôre done</strong> Sand the support and maybe toss on a coat of shellac.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="the-left-side-support">The left side support</h1>

<p>The left side support is quite similar. There are some key differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the 15.75‚Äù conduit</li>
  <li>Make 0.75‚Äù risers out of whatever you have.</li>
  <li>Remember that the left side support plywood piece will not be the same size as the outfeed, because it‚Äôs offset by the spacers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at my lazy spacers. They‚Äôre just offcuts of 0.75‚Äù plywood with a 0.25‚Äù hole drilled in the center.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/TSExtension/LeftSideMod.jpg"><img src="/assets/TSExtension/Thumbnails/LeftSideMod.jpg" alt="I became rather lazy by this point. I'll improve this at some point, maybe." /></a></p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>I know my saw is on the stand backwards. This conserves space since I need to walk around the left side of the saw in my shop. The right side extension wing goes over the sand‚Äôs extended foot. I personally recommend this instead of the ascribed assembly method.</p>

<p>I have updated the bolts since taking the photos 1‚Äù hex-head are much better for this project.</p>

<p>The total cost for this project for me was $8.88 after tax. I didn‚Äôt need to buy the plywood, nylon lock washers, UHMW tape or conduit. At most this will cost you about $15 if you‚Äôre thrifty about the plywood.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="video-caption">Midi notes modulating parameter values</div>

<p>Keytracking is a capability that many synthesizers have. It allows you to modulate a parameter by the value of the incoming midi note.</p>

<p>This capability is very useful to be applied outside of a synthesizer. Perhaps you want your higher frequency synth notes to have more reverb than the lower frequency notes, or maybe you want an LFO to be less drastic when you’re playing bass notes.</p>

<p>I’ve written a JSFX script for reaper that allows you to use midi-note values to modulate parameters. Let me show you how to use it.</p>

<p>Line6 Helix Native. It’s not cheap, but is it worth it?</p>

<p>Today I’m going to walk you through Line6 Helix and everything it has to offer, both to guitarists/bassists and <em>other</em> musicians/producers.</p>

<p>This is a BIG review, and there’s a video review as well.</p>

<p>I cover <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> (except legacy effects) so hold on to your pants. We’re gonna figure out if a guitar plugin can really be worth $399.99.</p>

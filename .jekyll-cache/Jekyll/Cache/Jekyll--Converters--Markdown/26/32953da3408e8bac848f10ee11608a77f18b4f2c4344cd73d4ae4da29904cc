<p>In this third-to-last post of the mixbus review, I’m covering the MIDI editing capabilities.</p>

<p>I will say that I am not primarily a MIDI-based musician. I do work with MIDI and softsynths in my freetime, however my knowledge of the needs of a professional composer are not personally acquired.</p>

<p>Let’s get on to it.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 4.2</strong></p>

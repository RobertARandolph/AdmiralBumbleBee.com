I"ý<p>The recent <a href="/music/2018/11/14/Cubase-10-update.html">Cubase post</a> took a lot out of me this week for content creation.</p>

<p>So I spend my effort doing a lot of backend improvement. Bugfixes on the site, improved nav-bar, youtube improvements and <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart</a> is improved.</p>

<p>I made a new video for the DAW Chart for people that like videos. The DAW Chart also <a href="/DAW-Explain.html#price">has price information now</a> and I fixed some ratings that were mildly errant.</p>

<p><strong>IF THE PAGE LOOKS WEIRD THEN DO THIS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safari - cmd-option-r</li>
  <li>Chrome - ctrl-F5 (Win) cmd-shift-r (Mac)</li>
  <li>Firefox - ctrl-F5 (Win) cmd-shift-r (Mac)</li>
</ul>

<p>I also changed some colours to make the page feel nicer to read.</p>

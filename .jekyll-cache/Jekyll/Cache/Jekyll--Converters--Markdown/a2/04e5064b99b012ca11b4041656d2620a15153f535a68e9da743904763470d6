<p>Sometimes in a project you may have some items with</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Preserve pitch when changing rate” off, so that you can stretch them and change the pitch.</li>
  <li>“Preserve pitch when changing rate” on so that you can stretch the item and <strong>not</strong> change the pitch.</li>
  <li>Pitch changes via the “Pitch Adjust” parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following script consolidates the selected items so they retain their length and pitch, but with “Preserve pitch when changing rate” on.</p>

<p>It does this by finding items with “Preserve pitch when changing rate” off, then it translates the rate to pitch, assigns that to the pitch value and turns on “Preserve pitch when changing rate”.</p>

I"t<p>I love my Bosch 4100 table saw. The gravity rise stand is amazing, it’s compact, it’s accurate, it’s well-made.</p>

<p>The issue is that with how compact it is, you need some sort of extension wings to <em>safely</em> support your work as you cut it.</p>

<p>Like most people you could simply buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1002-Outfeed-Support-Extension/dp/B00004R5S0/">TS1002 Outfeed Support Extension</a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1016-Outfeed-Support-Assembly/dp/B0105D9LRY/">TS1016 Outfeed Support Assembly</a> for outfeed support. You’ll also need a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1003-Table-Support-Extension/dp/B00004R5S2/">TS1003 Left Side Support Table</a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-TS1008-Left-Support-Table/dp/B0105D9ME6/">TS1008 Left Side Support Table</a> for left side support.</p>

<p>Those damn things are too expensive, and we’re workshop men! <strong>We can make our own things.</strong> Let me show you how I made mine</p>

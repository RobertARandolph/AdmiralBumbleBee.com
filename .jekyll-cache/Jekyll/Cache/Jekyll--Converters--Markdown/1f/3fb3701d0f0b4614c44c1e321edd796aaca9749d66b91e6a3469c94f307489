<p>Let me start this out by being totally clear: This is not the first time Iâ€™ve used <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic Pro X</a>. Iâ€™ve used Logic 9 and Logic Pro X for 100s (1000s?) of hours in the past. <em>However</em>, Iâ€™ve never blogged my experiences using it, and Iâ€™ve never used it as my primary and <em>only</em> DAW for any significant period of time.</p>

<p>That starts now! For the next 30 days I will be using only <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic Pro X</a>. I will be covering things I normally cover like: <a href="/music/2017/06/07/Bitwig-first-impressions.html">my first impressions</a>, <a href="/music/2016/06/26/CubaSeductive.html">features I really like</a>, <a href="/music/2016/12/16/Things-I-hate-about-Digital-Performer.html">things I really dislike</a>, and <a href="/music/2017/09/30/Review-of-Mixbus-effect-plugins.html">reviews of included content</a>.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have much to cover now. Iâ€™ve already spent ~12 hours converting projects, reading the <em>entire</em> Logic manual (twice) and re-familiarizing myself with the shortcuts. Soon will come a more in-depth post.</p>

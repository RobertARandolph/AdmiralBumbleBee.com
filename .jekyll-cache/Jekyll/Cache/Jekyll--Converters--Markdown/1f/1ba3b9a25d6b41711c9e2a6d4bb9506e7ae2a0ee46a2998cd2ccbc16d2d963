I"´<p>The 30 Days of Reaper comes to an end today. Iâ€™ve been through <a href="/music/2017/04/04/Things-that-I-really-dislike-about-Reaper.html">the worst</a> and <a href="/studio/2017/03/30/Things-that-I-really-like-about-Reaper.html">found some</a> <a href="/music/2017/04/18/Reapers-Amazing,-but-Awful,-Almost-Anything-to-Anywhere-Routing.html">cool stuff</a>.</p>

<p>If you know me, or have read any earlier blog posts you would know how much Iâ€™ve hated Reaper, and the â€œReaper Usersâ€ (out in the wild at least).</p>

<p>So if youâ€™ve been following my blog you may or may not be surprised at the conclusion of this, especially after my recent trials of Studio One and Cubase.</p>

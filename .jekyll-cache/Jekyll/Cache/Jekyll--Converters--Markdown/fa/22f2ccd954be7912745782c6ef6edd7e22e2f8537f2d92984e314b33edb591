<p>This weekâ€™s post is not a post about music, but instead itâ€™s a post about tools that I use to write this music centric website and tools I use to create music software.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m talking about a text editor. So in this post I will be discussing my thoughts about text editors, what features I enjoy, what features I do not need and my thoughts about various products on the market currently.</p>

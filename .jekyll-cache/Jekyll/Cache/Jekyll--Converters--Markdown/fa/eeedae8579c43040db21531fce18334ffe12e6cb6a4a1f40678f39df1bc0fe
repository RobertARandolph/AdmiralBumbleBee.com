I"v<p>If you take a look up on the menu bar, you will see a new feature on the site: <a href="/ReaperScripts.html">The Reaper Script Showcase</a>.</p>

<p>I have compiled a number of the flashiest and most useful Reaper scripts in to a central location and created very short videos+explanations of their usefulness. If you know of any cool scrips then please let me know!</p>

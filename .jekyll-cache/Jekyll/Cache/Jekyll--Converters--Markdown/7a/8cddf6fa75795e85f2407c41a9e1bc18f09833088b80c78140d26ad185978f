I"¿<p>Thereâ€™s going to be a plethora of amazing sound examples out in the coming weeks for Axiom, but I think I can provide you a unique experience with <a href="/programming/2017/01/30/Comparator.html">my comparator</a>. That means that all of these sounds are LUFS normalized to -18dB LUFS for better comparison.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll do a few styles of guitar, some bass, some drums and some synth processing. These samples donâ€™t come remotely close to covering what Axiom is capable of, but itâ€™s something to whet your appetite.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried to keep the riffs simple. I also left in the finger noises, buzzing and other bits. There was no editing or corrective effects applied at all.</p>

<p>Each example will have notes about the guitar used, and a dry clip that you can reference against. I am not using presets here. I created most of these from scratch, so youâ€™re hearing partially my tastes and Axiomâ€™s capability.</p>

<p>Sound samples are recorded in to a <a href="https://us.focusrite.com/thunderbolt-audio-interfaces/clarett-8prex">Focusrite Clarett 8PreX</a> using the instrument input or using a self-made DI box using a <a href="http://www.lundahl.se/wp-content/uploads/datasheets/1935.pdf">Lundahl 1935 transformer</a>.</p>

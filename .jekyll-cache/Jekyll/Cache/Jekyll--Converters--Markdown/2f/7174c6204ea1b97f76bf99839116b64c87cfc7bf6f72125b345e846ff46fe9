<p>Gain staging. Itâ€™s a popular phrase now. It was a popular phrase before, but it is now too. There was a short period in the late 80s, 90s and early 00â€™s where, as digital tookover, people forgot it was a thing.</p>

<p>Now we have a whole generation of musically-inclined people that are learning to work entirely digitally, and the necessity of gain staging has slipped by their grasp. It used to be an obvious skill, but now the benefits are a matter of workflow rather than a matter of basic operation.</p>

<p>I get asked about gain staging all the time, and while I generally try to avoid writing about things that are already explained elsewhere, I am going to tackle this one. Why? Because thereâ€™s one aspect of gain staging that matters to everyone, and almost nobody discusses it.</p>

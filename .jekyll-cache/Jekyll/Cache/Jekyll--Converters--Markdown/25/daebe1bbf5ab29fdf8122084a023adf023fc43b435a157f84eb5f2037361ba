<p><a href="http://www.bakingsteel.com">A Baking steel</a> is basically just a chunk of steel that you stuff in your oven, heat up then cook on. It helps retain heat, evenly distribute heat and heat the underside of whatever you‚Äôre doing.</p>

<p>Rather than pay $100+ for one you can easily make your own. Here‚Äôs what we did‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Just a chunk of some mild steel. This was about 20‚Äùx20‚Äùx0.25‚Äù. It was purchased at the local steel yard very cheaply.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_scale">mill scale</a> needs to be removed along with any rust. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid">Muriatic Acid</a> along with proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment">PPE</a>.</p>

<p>BE CAREFUL! It just takes a few cycles of acid-&gt;scrub-&gt;rinse and you‚Äôre good to go.</p>

<p>The steel purchased was too large to fit in the oven it was to be used in. So it was cut with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cutting">plasma cutter</a>. Using a piece of plywood as a guide is totally fine despite what you may think otherwise. The risk of it catching fire is very, very low.</p>

    <img src="/assets/BakingSteel/Thumbnails/Grind.jpg" alt="Grind it down">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">Grind the edges</div>

<p>Plasma cutting can leave somewhat of a rough edge, but all the edges need to be cleaned up anyway. An angle grinder makes quick work of this.</p>

  <a href="/assets/BakingSteel/Sand.jpg">
    <img src="/assets/BakingSteel/Thumbnails/Sand.jpg" alt="Clean up again">
  </a>
  <div class="image-caption">Sand the surfaces</div>

<p>The surfaces were now wet-sanded to #400. Wet sanding is important, and using a finish sander is also important. Larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_orbital_sander">Random Orbital Sanders</a> can cause swirly marks that a finish sander will not.</p>

<p>After some use, it appears that sanding to a lower grit may be more appropriate. #220 at most. This will make it easier for the <a href="http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/">Seasoning</a> to stick.</p>

<p>Just look at that beautiful wood-like texture. So nice.</p>

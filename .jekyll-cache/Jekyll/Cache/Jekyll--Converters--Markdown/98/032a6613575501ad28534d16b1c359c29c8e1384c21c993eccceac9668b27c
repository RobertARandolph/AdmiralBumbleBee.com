<p>I recently had the wonderful opportunity to interview <a href="http://robstenson.com">Rob Stenson</a>, who you may know better from <a href="https://goodhertz.co">Goodhertz</a> or maybe as <a href="https://robstenson.bandcamp.com">a banjoist</a>. I use Goodhertz plugins as a reference for various plugin functionality, so I was excited to have this chat.</p>

<p>I tried to shy away from <a href="https://tonal.goodhertz.co">any information you can already find</a>, such as <a href="https://tonal.goodhertz.co/interview-with-rob/">this interview of himself</a>(??) or <a href="http://my1stinstrument.com/about/">this other interview of himself</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy, and Iâ€™d like to thank Rob for the opportunity and his time yet again!</p>

<p>Recently I came in to possession of a <a href="https://lagunatools.com/accessories/bandsaw-accessories/bandsaw-blades/resaw-king-bandsaw-blade/">Laguna Resaw King</a> bandsaw blade. I heard that it leaves tablesaw-like quality cuts, and would be superior to my <a href="http://www.spectrumsupply.com/kerfmaster-2.aspx">Spectrum Supply KerfMaster</a> or <a href="http://www.highlandwoodworking.com/woodslicer-resaw-bandsaw-blades.aspx">Highland Woodslicer</a>.</p>

<p>So to test this, I took a piece of <a href="http://www.wood-database.com/jatoba/">Jatoba</a> which is a wood I use very often, and rip cut it on the same <a href="http://www.grizzly.com/products/14-Extreme-Series-Bandsaw/G0555X">Grizzly G0555X with a riser block</a> with various blades. I timed myself to try and keep the feed rate identical. From there I also prepared samples with low, medium and high angle blade setups in my <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/Page.aspx?p=51870&amp;cat=1,41182,48944,51870">Veritas bevel-up smoother</a>, my tablesaw with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DW7140PT-10-Inch-Ripping-Crosscutting/dp/B000HCTUC0">Dewalt DW7140PT</a> blade, and both sides of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ryoba-Double-Razor-Hardwoods-Woodworker/dp/B00BSQU9UQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506089533&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=hardwood+ryoba">Gyokucho Ryoba for hardwoods</a>.</p>

<p>From there I took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_photography">macro photographs</a> of each sample in the same lighting. I used a <a href="https://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_600d/">Canon 600d</a> with a <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/standard-zoom/ef-s-18-55mm-f-3-5-5-6-is-ii">EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS</a> on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fotodiox-Reverse-Camera-Adapter-Filter/dp/B001G4PA36">Reversing Ring</a>. The angle of some photos is changed slightly to help accentuate certain details. You may notice a large variation in colour across the photos, but that is representative of the changes in the wood itself as a result of the preparation method! The frame size is ~4mm.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve organized the images in order from what I feel is worst quality finish to best.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s get on to itâ€¦</p>

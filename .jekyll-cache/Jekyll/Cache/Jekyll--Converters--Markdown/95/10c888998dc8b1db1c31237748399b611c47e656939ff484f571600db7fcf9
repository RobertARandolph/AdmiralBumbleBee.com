<p>A frequent scenario for some Reaper users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple MIDI items
    <ul>
      <li>Each item corresponds to parts of the same instrument (like drums - kick, snare, toms, cymbals etcâ€¦)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Editing the files requires working with many parts at once</li>
  <li>You go crazy jumping between MIDI items</li>
</ul>

<p>We can fix this, and make it easy to use. It can also be toggled on/off.</p>

<p>Today Iâ€™m also doing a companion video. It covers the exact same thing as the text, but in video form. This is an experiment, so <strong>Iâ€™d like feedback on it!</strong> The video is in 4k resolution.</p>

<p>If it works out and I am happy with the output, Iâ€™ll try to do this for future posts as well.</p>

I"º<p>Crusty dried paint or finish on the edge of cans is just a horrible waste of money. It causes air gaps to form around the rim when trying to close the can and accelerate the life of the product. It causes pointless drips and mess. Itâ€™s also just not fun.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also really easy to avoidâ€¦ Just follow the pictures.</p>

I"g<p>The <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Feature Chart</a> has been updated for Logic 10.4, Bitwig 2.2.3, Pro Tools 2018.1 and Mixbus 4.3.</p>

<p>Since the ratings are relative to each other, many ratings have changed. When one product improves, other ratings may be reduced to reflect the relative capability in that category.</p>

<p>Once again! This is a reminder that <strong>the chart doesn’t communicate how “good” a DAW is</strong>. It’s just a <em>feature</em> chart. A DAW may offer a fantastic workflow that provides all the features that you need.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions!</p>

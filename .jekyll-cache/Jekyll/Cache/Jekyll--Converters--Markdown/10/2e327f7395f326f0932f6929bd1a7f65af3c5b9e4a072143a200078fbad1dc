I"<p>Today we’re going to have a tutorial on how to replace the switches on the Yamaha RM1x. Why would you do this you may ask? There’s a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The switches break. It’s fairly common for the switches on this machine to go bad and be very difficult to use.</li>
  <li>You can have better feel on your switches. Switches with a tactile click are much better for this purpose.</li>
  <li>Resale value! The RM1x is worth more when the most common problem and complaint is resolved.</li>
</ul>

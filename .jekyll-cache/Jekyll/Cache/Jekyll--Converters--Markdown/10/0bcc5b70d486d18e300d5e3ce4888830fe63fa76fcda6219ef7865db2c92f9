<p>Iâ€™m going to be taking a look at <a href="https://www.tracktion.com/products/retromod">The Retromod series</a> from <a href="https://www.tracktion.com/">Tracktion Corporation</a>.</p>

<p>I already reviewed their <a href="tags/#Tracktion+Waveform">DAW product</a> which was quite nice. I also reviewed <a href="/music/2018/04/08/Waveform-9-instruments-and-effect-review.html#biotek">their flagship synthesizer: Biotek</a>, and that is quite a monster.</p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> pay for these products. I was given an NFR (not-for-resale) copy for review. I try my best to not let this affect my opinions. If you feel like I did, then please say so in the comments.</p>

<p>Retromod takes on the task of getting more vintage sounds, so letâ€™s see what they came up with.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/vecoc6ju-1M">Video review is available too!</a></p>

<p>I previous <a href="/tags/#Mixbus">did a review series about Mixbus 32c 4.x</a>. <a href="http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus32c.html">Harrison Mixbus</a> is a relatively new DAW in the music world, yet has easily managed to insert itself in to the pro audio world as a contender.</p>

<p>I took some time to discuss Mixbus with <a href="http://www.benloftis.com/portfolio.html">Ben Loftis</a>. We covered some of the history of Mixbus, goals, design challenges and team management.</p>

<p>This interview was conducted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>. I attempted to keep most of the content intact as written, but I made some edits so that the text is more clear for non-native english readers. If you have questions, please leave a comment and I will clarify and/or edit that section.</p>

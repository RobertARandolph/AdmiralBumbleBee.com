<p>Itâ€™s time for the Logic Effects review, finally! Sorry this has taken nearly an extra week, but weâ€™re here now. I spent 55 hours specifically reading the effects manual, evaluating every plugin on a number of sources, testing with various analysis tools, reading the manual again, writing about plugins and editing this document. (Iâ€™m totally sick of it btw, jeez). That doesnâ€™t include the time Iâ€™ve spent so far just casually using the products. There may be an error here or there, so please let me know if you see one!</p>

<p>This time Iâ€™m doing the effects review differently than I have in the past (<a href="/music/2017/09/30/Review-of-Mixbus-effect-plugins.html">Mixbus Effects</a>, <a href="/music/2017/10/06/Review-of-Mixbus-instrument-and-MIDI-plugins.html">Mixbus Instruments</a>, <a href="/music/2017/06/27/Bitwig-Effects-review.html">Bitwig Effects</a>, <a href="/music/2017/06/29/Bitwig-Instruments-Review.html">Bitwig Instruments</a>, <a href="/studio/2017/02/08/Cubase-9-Audio-Effects-Review.html">Cubase Effects</a>, <a href="/music/2016/05/31/Studio-compOnents-review.html">Studio One Effects</a> and <a href="/music/2016/06/05/Studio-ContraptiOnes.html">Studio One Instruments</a>). Instead of rating every single plugin, Iâ€™m splitting the plugins in to 3 categories: Fantastic, Sufficient and Flawed. The categorization is decided as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fantastic</strong> - These are plugins that I think would be an excellent value to purchase if possible. Likewise, they compare favourably with third-party plugins on the market.</li>
  <li><strong>Sufficient</strong> - Sufficient get the job done without much hassle. There may be no fancy extra features like some third-party competitors, or maybe the DAW version is missing some common feature, but nevertheless itâ€™s enough to get the job done.</li>
  <li><strong>Flawed</strong> - As the name implies, these plugins have some sort of flaw. I would suggest replacing these with a third-party product.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the plugins are vectorized for clean resizing and retina screens. Iâ€™ve marked the non-vectorized models as of Logic 10.4.</p>

<p>There will be a total rating for everything included though, and that rating isâ€¦</p>

<p>Spoiler - Overall rating: <admrb rating="92"> </admrb></p>

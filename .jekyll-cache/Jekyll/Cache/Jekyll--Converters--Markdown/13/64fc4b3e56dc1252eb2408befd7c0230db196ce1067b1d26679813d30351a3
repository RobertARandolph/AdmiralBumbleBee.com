<p>Alright, here we go. This is some fun stuff. Modulation in FLStudio.</p>

<p>What I mean by modulation is automatically changing parameters without link to automation. Such as having a waveform modulate a parameter, or some envelope or other means.</p>

<p>This is a place where FLStudio really shines, and it seems like one of those places that few FL users even venture. They should!</p>

<p>Itâ€™s equally as <a href="/music/2017/06/23/Bitwig-Modulators.html">awesome as Bitwigâ€™s modulators</a>, but for different reasons.</p>

<p>Onwards!</p>

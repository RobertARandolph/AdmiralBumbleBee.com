<p>Harrison recently <a href="https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/ava-plugins.html">Released the AVA Mastering EQ</a>. I <a href="/music/2017/09/30/Review-of-Mixbus-effect-plugins.html##xt-me-mastering-equalizer">already reviewed its Mixbus cousin</a> and quite frankly I didnâ€™t think too highly of it based on the asking price.</p>

<p>AVA Mastering EQ is a VST/AU/AAX version of XT-ME at a <strong>far</strong> more reasonable price of $49 (on May 1st, 2018). I suggest simply taking this price in to consideration as I explore this product.</p>

<p>This is not a review per se. This is my curiosity being documented. Iâ€™m just going to explore the product and take you along for the ride. If you think my findings are evidence of a purchase worth $29 then go for it.</p>

<p>I was given this plugin for beta testing, and I talk with a number of employees at Harrison frequently now. Iâ€™m <em>fairly</em> certain that my personal views on this product are tainted by my relationship with their team at this point. So Iâ€™m going to avoid giving a final recommendation of any sort. Keep in mind that my exploration may be similarly influencedâ€¦ or not. You decide.</p>

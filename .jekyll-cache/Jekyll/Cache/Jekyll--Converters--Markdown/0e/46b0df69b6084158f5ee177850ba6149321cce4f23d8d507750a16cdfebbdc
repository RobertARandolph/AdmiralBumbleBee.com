I"t<p><strong>THANK YOU!!</strong></p>

<p>I appreciate your desire to donate. This helps me greatly in financing hosting costs, my time and the software/tools I use to create these posts. I put a lot of effort and money in to this project, so every penny counts.</p>

<p>Please be aware that there are, and never will be, ads on these page. I code all of my JS vanilla. I carefully optimize all images on the site. Videos usually have a poster. No auto-loading videos with sound. (I do use disqus for comments though!). <em>I value your bandwidth, time and intelligence.</em> This costs me extra time and money.</p>

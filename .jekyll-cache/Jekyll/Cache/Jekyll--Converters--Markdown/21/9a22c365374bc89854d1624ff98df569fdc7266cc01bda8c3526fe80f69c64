<p>Iâ€™ve updated the <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Feature Chart</a> with some big rating changes. Mixbus is finished for V4.2. I added a couple new categories as well. Reaper was lowered in some areas (oh no!).</p>

<p>I also updated all of the old DAW Chart posts with a link to the new version.</p>

<p>All of the categories/sections have links that link to an explanation of what that rating considers.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or questions about ratings, please leave a comment or e-mail me. Thank you!</p>

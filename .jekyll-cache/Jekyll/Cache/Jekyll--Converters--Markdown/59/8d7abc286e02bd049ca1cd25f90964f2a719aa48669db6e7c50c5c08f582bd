<p>Do you have multiple computers, and use multiple mice? Then surely you’ve experienced the frustration of moving between the computers and the cursor movement feeling different. This really annoys me, and maybe it annoys you.</p>

<p>I’ve written a little calculator to help you translate your mouse cursor movement between devices and I explain how/why it works.</p>

<p>This is a wall-of-text with minimal pictures, but it’s worth reading if you care about your computer workflow.</p>

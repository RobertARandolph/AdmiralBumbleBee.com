<p>I recently had an opportunity to interview one of the Software Developers and UX designers at Steinberg.</p>

<p>Often it is easy to forget that the people behind the software use are real people that are excited about working on the software and are <em>truly</em> trying to put out the best product they can under the circumstances of time and resources.</p>

<p>So this is just a short interview with one of the fantastic people working there.</p>

<p>(I‚Äôm not Steinberg biased, every company has similar people. This is simply the company that I choose).</p>

<h3 id="interviewee">Interviewee</h3>

<p>Vanessa Heinl, Software Developer &amp; UX Design Engineer</p>

<h3 id="what-was-your-role-in-developing-the-product">What was your role in developing the product?</h3>

<p>I work at Steinberg as a UI software developer and UX design engineer. My role is to identify usability problems and then work on those together with the other members of the team. In <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/cubase/new-in-10/">Cubase 10</a>, that included HiDPI, AddTrack, Latency Monitor, VST Plug-in Pictures and the extension of Media Rack to include third party plug-ins and effects.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-end-up-working-with-steinberg">How did you end up working with Steinberg?</h3>

<p>I studied media technology at the <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/english.html">HAW College of Applied Sciences in Hamburg</a>. Steinberg regularly gives lectures there for students. I wanted to develop audio products after my studies and the Steinberg lecture inspired me to the extent that I applied to join the company after I finished my course. And it worked out. I‚Äôve been with Steinberg for five years now and I really like working there.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-use-steinberg-products-when-your-workday-is-over">How do you use Steinberg products when your workday is over?</h3>

<p>I like writing lyrics and playing along on the guitar. I record that into Cubase and work on it there. It‚Äôs a hobby for me or together with my family, and that‚Äôs something I did even before starting to work at Steinberg.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-your-some-of-your-interests-outside-of-work">What are your some of your interests outside of work?</h3>

<p>I do a lot of different sports, and I like going to concerts. If I have enough time, I take the opportunity to see a bit of the world.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-tell-us-about-a-time-where-you-saw-some-of-you-hard-work-being-used-and-it-had-an-impression-on-you">Can you tell us about a time where you saw some of you hard work being used and it had an impression on you?</h3>

<p>Actually, every time I see someone using something I‚Äôve worked on it makes me happy. The first feature I worked on was the <a href="https://steinberg.help/cubase_pro_artist/v9/en/cubase_nuendo/topics/installing_and_managing_plugins/plugin_manager_window_r.html">Plug-in Manager</a> in Cubase 8. That‚Äôs special to me because it was the first. I especially remember standing in a newsagent‚Äôs reading <a href="https://www.soundandrecording.de">Sound &amp; Recording magazine</a> (N.B. German MI magazine) and finding an article about Cubase 8.5. There was a big picture of the Media Rack, which was praised in the article.</p>

<h3 id="there-seems-to-be-an-unusually-collaborative-process-at-steinberg-do-you-think-this-comes-from-the-large-number-of-the-team-with-musical-backgrounds">There seems to be an unusually collaborative process at Steinberg, do you think this comes from the large number of the team with musical backgrounds?</h3>

<p>Many of us do have a musical background, play an instrument and identify with the product. The enthusiasm and commitment at Steinberg is very high.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-your-musical-interests-anything-youve-heard-recently-that-you-enjoy">What are your musical interests? Anything you‚Äôve heard recently that you enjoy?</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs very mixed. Right now, I enjoy listening to <a href="https://www.imaginedragonsmusic.com">Imagine Dragons</a>, they‚Äôre from Las Vegas. They played in Hamburg this year and it was an amazing concert. I also listen to a lot of bands from Germany like <a href="http://www.hundredsmusic.com">Hundreds</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolverheld">Revolverheld</a>.</p>

<h3 id="thanks-from-the-interviewer">Thanks from the interviewer</h3>

<p>I {:nick ‚ÄúAdmiraBumbleBee‚Äù :name ‚ÄúRobert Randolph‚Äù} would like to thank Vanessa Heinl for taking the time to write. A big thanks also to Stefan Trowbridge for helping me reaching one of the talented devs at Steinberg, and being an overall cool person.</p>

<p>Remember that when you whine about an update, there‚Äôs <em>likely</em> very passionate people behind the scenes that honestly wanted to put out something good. It may not have been exactly what you want, but someone worked hard on it regardless. A bit of respect goes a long way!</p>

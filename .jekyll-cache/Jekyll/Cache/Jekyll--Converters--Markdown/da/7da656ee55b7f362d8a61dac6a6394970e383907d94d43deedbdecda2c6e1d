<p>Upon Popular request… this website now has a ‘dark mode’. Just hit that ‘Dark Theme’ or ‘Light Theme’ button in the navigation bar to switch. The value is saved with a 1000 day cookie.</p>

<p>The DAW Feature Chart is still the same colours. It’s pretty mild so I won’t change that unless there’s some request.</p>

<p>I wrote this myself and I’m certainly no javascript genius. I’m also not a designer by any means, so I’m sure I can improve the theme colours.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works… (please berate me if I did something stupid, thank you).</p>

<p>p.s. This <strong>was broken</strong> only when viewing the page for this post. I’ve since fixed that. Sorry!</p>

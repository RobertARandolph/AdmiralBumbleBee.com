<p>Well, <a href="https://ardour.org/whatsnew.html">Ardour 5.0 has been released</a> and honestly it looks pretty good. So for this next month, I will be using Ardour as much as possible.</p>

<p>It will be added to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Gvq6d4qXsxwpUmpZcCfpMF7Pt6zycktWr9wGb_SxRE/edit?usp=sharing">DAW Comparison chart</a> and I will blog my evaluation of various aspects as I experience it.</p>

<p>Here we go!</p>

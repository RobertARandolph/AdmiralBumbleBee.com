<p>My wife broke the ice cream scoop. It’s not a fancy one, but it’s the one we have.</p>

<p>So what’s my job? My job is to fix it of course… after being reminded about a dozen times. It’s basically ‘Husband Energy’. Each reminder slowly builds up sufficient energy so that I can complete the task, but the task can not be completed until that energy is sufficiently in store.</p>

<p>It’s go time!</p>

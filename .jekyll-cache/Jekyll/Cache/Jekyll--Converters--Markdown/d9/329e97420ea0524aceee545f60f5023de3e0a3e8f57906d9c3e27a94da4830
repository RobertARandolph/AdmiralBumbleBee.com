<p>Alright, I’m setting some basic levels here. Ah, ok where’s the option to setup track visibility in the mixer? I guess I have to check the menu. Nope. The mixer changes the OS Level menu. So in OS X, when you open the mixer, you can’t access any of the other Reaper menu options. You have to close the mixer, use the menu, re-open the mixer.</p>

<p>Mixer does not respond to cmd-`. That’s nice. Rather than the reflexive cmd-`, I have to remember to hit cmd-m, which is not even remotely a comfortable shortcut to use.</p>

<p>Keep forgetting what I am doing when having to think of how to change away from the mixer. Hit cmd-` and nothing happens. Look for menu, nothing there. By time I switch my thought process back to troubleshooting mode, whatever I was doing before is totally gone. Back to the mixer again so maybe I can remember what I was doing! (and forget again)</p>

<p>Right. I’m sure this is just as simple as getting used to things…</p>

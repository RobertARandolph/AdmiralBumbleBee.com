<p>In a recent post about Mixbus 32câ€™s mixer <a href="/music/2017/09/18/Mixbus-32c-The-Mixer.html#eq">I discussed some â€˜issuesâ€™ with the EQ</a>. Iâ€™ve since discussed this issue with a number of people, including engineers at Harrison.</p>

<p>So the purpose of this post is to clarify some things, correct a potential error, and help you understand (at a very basic level) how and why digital EQs differ.</p>

<p>This doesnâ€™t cover <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>, just one specific difference between EQs in the context of this discussion.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s get on with it!</p>

<p>Blue Cat recently released Axiom 1.1 and Destructor 1.4, and it came with a feature that I absolutely love: <a href="https://www.bluecataudio.com/Blog/tip-of-the-day/loading-impulse-responses-in-axiom-destructor-guitar-cabs/">IR Loading</a>.</p>

<p>But don’t roll your eyes just yet, this is one of the finest Impulse Response loaders that’s inside <a href="/music/2018/04/15/Blue-Cat-Axiom-Plugin-Review.html">one of the finest guitar plugins out there</a></p>

<p>I want to take a few minutes here to show you what it is, and why I think it’s so cool.</p>

<p>There’s also some other changes, such as the drag-and-drop ability in Axiom. I just <em>really</em> like the new IR Loader, so that’s all I’m going to talk about here.</p>

<p>While doing my <a href="/music/2017/11/03/30-Days-without-Fabfilter-products.html">30 days without Fabfilter</a> Iâ€™ve realized just how great of an EQ that <a href="https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-q-2-equalizer-plug-in">Fabfilter Pro-Q 2</a> really is.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t yet found anything that does <em>everything</em> that it does, and does it as well. <a href="http://apulsoft.ch/apqualizr2/">Apqualizr 2</a> is an excellent alternative with its own unique strengths, but for every feature it has that Pro-Q 2 doesâ€¦ Pro-Q 2 has an equally valuable feature that Apqualizr is missing.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s many alternatives. Rather than go through the products themselves, I thought Iâ€™d take some time to explain exactly what I am looking for in an EQ at a high-level. Iâ€™m ignoring some more esoteric things and sticking largely to things that impact my workflow directly.</p>

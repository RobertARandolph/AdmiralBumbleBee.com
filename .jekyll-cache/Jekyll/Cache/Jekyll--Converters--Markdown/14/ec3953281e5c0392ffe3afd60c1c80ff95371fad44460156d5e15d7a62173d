<p>Anyone thatâ€™s familiar with me, <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">or the DAW Feature Chart</a>, probably thinks that <strong>I dislike Ableton Live</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Youâ€™d be right</strong>. I try to be as fair as possible in the DAW Feature Chart, but I personally have had a history of issues with Live.</p>

<p>I toured with Ableton Live (5-8) and was invested heavily in their products and third-party products, and <em>over and over and over and over and over</em> I was either let down by the stability, or met resistance when trying to work with large projects or â€˜large tasksâ€™.</p>

<p>I will be using Live 10.1(beta and release) for <em>at least</em> the next 45 days. I will be using it for personal music creation and indulging my own curiosities. I will try to be as fair as possible, and I <em>strongly encourage</em> anyone reading to speak up if you think Iâ€™ve made a mistake or have represented the product unfairly.</p>

<p>I hope to make this an interesting series. Iâ€™m going into this with fewer positive expectations than Iâ€™ve ever had.</p>

<p>I’m 20 days in to my 30 days with <a href="http://www.reaper.fm">Reaper</a>.</p>

<p>In the last 5 days, my time spent in each DAW as a percentage, according to <a href="https://manytricks.com/timesink/">Time Sink</a> has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaper - 99%</li>
  <li>DP - 1%</li>
</ul>

<p>I am actually getting along with Reaper very nicely now. It’s not required much customization, but a lot of learning about what <em>can be done</em>. In this post I’m going to go over some of the things that I’ve changed that really improved the experience for me.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Heda Track Inspector pop-up</div>

<p>I feel like <a href="https://reaper.hector-corcin.com/app/track-templates">HeDa Track Inspector VIP</a> is an absolute must have. It’s a fantastic way to work when you don’t want a mixer open.</p>

<p>I currently have a <a href="#custom-actions">custom action</a> setup so if I hover over a track, I can press the ‘Q’ key to pop-up a Heda Track Inspector. See the gif for an example.</p>

<h2 id="heda-loudness-graph-vip">HeDa Loudness Graph VIP</h2>

<p>Yet another extremely useful script from HeDa. The <a href="https://reaper.hector-corcin.com/app/loudness-graph">Loudness Graph VIP</a> displays a ridiculous amount of useful information in an easy to see graph format.</p>

<p>Really fantastic tool.</p>

<h2 id="radial-menus">Radial Menus</h2>

  <div class="image-caption">Radial Menus</div>

<p>I had planned to show my monsterous Radial Menus setup, but the active and friendly developer <a href="http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=186637">helped me out with some ideas</a> to improve my current setup.</p>

<p>Radial menus can open a different menu based on context, it supports swiping (with various settings), colouring options, shortcut to specific menus and more.</p>

<p>I know that radial menus aren’t a new thing, but this is one of the nicest implementations that I’ve seen in any software, let alone in a DAW!.</p>

<h1 id="screensets">Screensets</h1>

  <img src="/assets/Reaper/Screensets.png" alt="Screensets">
  <div class="image-caption">Screensets</div>

<p>I have setup 3 screensets. That’s it. F4, F5 and F6. Edit, Mix, Midi.</p>

<p>I have various windows open (track manager, performance, undo window, fx, etc..) depending on what I’m doing. Screensets (or the analog) aren’t anything fancy, but in Reaper it’s <em>really</em> a key to getting your environment setup how you want it. In most other DAWs you can get by without ever touching that feature, but I don’t think that’s possible in Reaper unless you A. like clutter or B. have very simple uses.</p>

<p>I’m certain that as I continue using Reaper over the next 10 (or more?) days, I will have at least 3 more screensets setup, but I’m still experimenting. As a <a href="http://sawstudio.com">SAWStudio</a> user, I had 20 that I used very frequently. I have 12 in <a href="http://motu.com/products/software/dp">Digital Performer</a> that are used constantly.</p>

<p>Folder tracks donâ€™t show levels when recording sub tracks. Very confusing. Spent ~15 minutes trying to see why my folder werenâ€™t working as groups only to give up and see them working on playback.</p>

<p>Trying to figure out how to zoom to a selection, 30 minutes of fiddling. Zoom commands not listed with shortcuts in the menu. Canâ€™t find â€˜zoom undoâ€™.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve already counted 21 floating windows. Iâ€™m fairly sure Iâ€™ve only just now opened pandoraâ€™s modal window.</p>

<p>Oh hey, some things dock. Waitâ€¦ sometimes. Why is that docked? Why isnâ€™t that docked? Whereâ€™d my dock go?! How do I re-dock this?!</p>

<p>WTF!? Why doesnâ€™t cmd-` work for anything. Ugh.</p>

<p>Ok fine, Iâ€™m going to just record some tracks. So how do I group some tracksâ€¦ a groud command? No, a window, of course. Can I cycle it with cmd-`? Of course not.</p>

<p>Tracks recorded. WTF why is a track moved? Oh, I moved it while trying to move the playback cursor.</p>

<p>Ok, letâ€™s re-align these drum tracks a bit. Oh jeez. I keep moving the playback cursor. Why isnâ€™t everything moving together? I have the tracks grouped!</p>

<p>Oh, you have to group the clipsâ€¦ that totally makes sense, not.</p>

<p>Fine, letâ€™s just try and mix this a bit. Let me grab pro-q2 to adjust the kick first andâ€¦ ANOTHER FLOATING WINDOW. TWO OF THEM. Just to add an effect.</p>

<p>Ugh. Forget it for today.</p>

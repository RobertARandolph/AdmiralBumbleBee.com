<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Please see the new <a href="/DAW-Chart.html"><strong>DAW Feature Chart</strong></a> for more up-to-date information and a way cooler chart.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve been following this blog then youâ€™d know that I recently tried 2 DAWS as my 1-month thing. Trying <a href="http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html">Cubase</a> has been a harrowing experience that has made me rethink using <a href="http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp">Digital Performer</a>.</p>

<p>Since it was very difficult for me to decide, given how great of a product Cubase is, I went ahead and did a methodical test and rating of both DAWs. I analyzed my projects to figure out what features I used most frequently, mildly and rarely. I looked at features of various DAWs that I thought were nice and considered those as well.</p>

<p>I then created a number of tests and attempted them multiple times with varying circumstances in each DAW. I wrote down a rating, relative to each DAWâ€™s capability. Results were weighted and tallied.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Some choices I've made</div>

<p>So a little over a month ago, <a href="/music/2017/11/03/30-Days-without-Fabfilter-products.html">I decided to not use any Fabfilter products for 30 days</a>. I felt like I rely on them perhaps too heavily.</p>

<p>This post is to help wrap this up and show my conclusions. I’ll discuss if there’s any products I felt were superior <em>for my uses</em>, if there’s any products I found a new respect for, and if I feel that the fabfilter option is simply the best in its class.</p>

<p>I won’t be talking about the sound quality of these products unless there’s some exceptional aspect of them worth mentioning. I think it goes without saying that I wouldn’t choose a product that I feel is sonically inferior.</p>

<p>Let’s do this.</p>

<p><em>note</em>: Pro-L 2 came out the day I released this, so it’s not considered.</p>

<p><em>p.s.</em>: Next 30 days is coming soon… 🍎</p>

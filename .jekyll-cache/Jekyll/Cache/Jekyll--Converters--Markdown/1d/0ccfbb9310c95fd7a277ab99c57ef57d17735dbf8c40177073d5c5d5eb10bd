I"•<p>Tiny postâ€¦ the <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Feature Chart</a> was updated to add Freezing features and an early addition of Scoring. The Scoring section will be slowly updated to include more fine-grained ratings, but for now it is a wholistic rating. I also added a new sub-category for â€˜Automation Toolsâ€™.</p>

<p>The Chart was updated for <a href="http://mixbus.harrisonconsoles.com/forum/thread-5507.html">Mixbus 4.3</a>, <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton Live 10</a> and <a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/what_is_new_in_cubase_95.html">Cubase 9.5</a>.</p>

<p>I also fixed some minor bugs in the script.</p>

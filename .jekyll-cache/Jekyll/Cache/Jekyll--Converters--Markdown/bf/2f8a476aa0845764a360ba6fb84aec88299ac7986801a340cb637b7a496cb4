<div class="image-caption">Selling out for Free Software</div>

<p>On Sunday the 18th of February, I held an interview with <a href="http://equalarea.com/paul/cv.html">Paul Davis</a> of the fantastic <a href="https://ardour.org">Ardour</a> audio software. I <a href="/music/2017/10/26/30-Days-with-Ardour-v2.html">covered Ardour in the past a few times</a>.</p>

<p>While Paul is not the only awesome person that works on the software, due to its open source nature, he is the benevolent dictator that helps keep things flowing.</p>

<p>I wanted to find out about some of the big changes that may be coming in Ardour 6.0. What are the changes? Why where the necessary? How do they benefit the average user?</p>

<p>Letâ€™s hit it!</p>

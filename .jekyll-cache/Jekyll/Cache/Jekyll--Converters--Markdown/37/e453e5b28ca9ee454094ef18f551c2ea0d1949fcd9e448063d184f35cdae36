<p>I usually try to avoid duplicating information that you can easily find online other places. I want my website to be full of relatively <em>unique</em> content. This week I needed to change the hard drive in my iMac because it was failing and I wanted something better. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+27-Inch+EMC+2309+and+2374+Hard+Drive+Replacement/1634">You can find out</a> how <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/02/13/how-to-swap-imac-hard-drive-for-ssd/">to do this</a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w6E2_XqaBw">a number of places</a>, so I’m not really bringing in groundbreaking content here.</p>

<p>I am doing the <a href="/music/2018/02/28/30-days-with-Tracktion-Waveform-9.html">30 days with Waveform</a> right now though, and I’ve been unable to progress on this review due to the large number of studio changes and the necessity to upgrade my main studio system.</p>

<p>Rather than having no posts for 7-8 days while I try to catch up, I’ve decided to show how I went about the process of changing my iMac’s 1tb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagate_Barracuda">Seagate Barracude</a> to a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/consumer/850evo/">1tb Samsung EVO 850</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagate_Barracuda">Solid State Drive</a>.</p>

<p>This is also a great citation if you’re a non-Mac person and want to show people why macs are awful. Likewise it’s a great post if you’re a mac user and want to suffer along with me.</p>

<p>Let’s get on with it.</p>

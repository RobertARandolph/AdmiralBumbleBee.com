<p>So far Iâ€™m really enjoying Cubase 8.5. My experience has been totally positive. Hereâ€™s a very quick rundown of what Iâ€™ve been pleasantly surprised withâ€¦</p>

<h1 id="rerecord">Rerecord</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/Cubase/rerecord.png" alt="Yes!" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m in love with the Re-Record feature. With rerecord turned on like in the photo, simply hitting the record button will undo your recording, reset the cursor position and restart recording.</p>

<p>If there is any feature Iâ€™ve liked more in a DAW, I can not think of it. Especially how this is implemented. I <strong>really really</strong> find this useful.</p>

<h1 id="the-manual">The manual</h1>

<p>One of the main things that I feel a manual should do is make it easy for you to find information about a feature or concept when you have no idea what itâ€™s called.</p>

<p>Cubaseâ€™s manual succeeds in this. Itâ€™s also very clearly formatted, well-written and thusfar contains nearly every piece of information that Iâ€™ve looked for. The manual has made learning Cubase a pleasant experience.</p>

<h1 id="the-mixer">The mixer</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/Cubase/mixerdrums.gif" alt="I like it so far" /></p>

<p>Cubase 8.5 gets a lot of flack about the new mixer. I really like it. Adjustable fader/meter sizing, built-in channel strip, clearly labeled and wellsized controlsâ€¦ itâ€™s great.</p>

<p>The various controls for â€˜deactivate all mute/soloâ€™ and Q-link among others are very handy. Other DAWs do have these features but they are tucked away. It can be difficult to make use of useful features when theyâ€™re tucked away and you are forced to try to make a habit out of using them.</p>

<p>I also really like the integration of input channels in the mixer, and that Cubase makes it easy to write effects when you record. That is a workflow that I enjoy.</p>

<p>Look at the image. I bet you can figure out exactly where everything is that you need. Thereâ€™s even a secondary mini-transport there.</p>

<h1 id="the-meters">The meters</h1>

<p>The meters in Cubase are smooth and responsive. Thank you. The gifs are only at 10fps, but donâ€™t let that fool you, in the software they are smooth.</p>

<h1 id="track-archives">Track Archives</h1>

<p>Being able to save a track or set of tracks and easily drop then in your project later is great. This isnâ€™t nearly as good as DPâ€™s clippings, but itâ€™s good enough.</p>

<h1 id="vst-connections">VST Connections</h1>

<p>If your I/O has the same names on multiple systems, Cubase can automatically hook up tracks even when a new device is used. This is so incredibly useful. Yes another major DAW can do this, but every one needs it. Itâ€™s so useful!</p>

<h1 id="group-editing-linked-to-folders">Group editing linked to folders</h1>

<p>I really like folders having a group-edit link function. I donâ€™t like the granularity of grouping in Cubase so far, but maybe Iâ€™ll find something else</p>

<h1 id="overall">Overall</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m really liking working in Cubase. I get confused now and then, and sometimes frustration cracks through, but the experience has been fluid. There are so many small workflow enhancements here that really make the experience nice.</p>

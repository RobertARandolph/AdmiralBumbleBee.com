I"û<p>Iâ€™ve been ill for about a week now, but hereâ€™s a quickie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Clark-Kimtech-Kimwipes-Delicate-Disposable/dp/B00RORBXA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462975144&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kimwipes">Kimwipes</a> are my favorite workshop thing now. Applying dye, shellac, wipeon finishes, cleaning glue and more.</p>

<p>No lint, absorbent and relatively cheap. They are small, but they last a long time. Buy a pack and see how useful they can be in your shop.</p>

I"Å<p>There are many free plug-ins on the market, there are many places where you can go and find free plug-ins that you know are going to be decent.</p>

<p>I aim to make this such a place.</p>

<p>This the place where you can find plug-ins that I have personally vetted and decided that they are worth trying.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="what-criteria-is-used">What criteria is used?</h2>

<p>There are three main criteria, and these are taken into account in a balanced manner. You can think of it like this: each category is rated on a scale from 1 to 10. If the total score is above 20 then it will make the list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>GUI - the GUI must be both usable and easy to look at. There must not be any glitchiness, bugs, menu diving or other common problems that interfere with UX. A big issue that I really dislike is when control printers are scaled so that commonly used values are difficult to select, this will immediately disqualify a product.</li>
  <li>DSP quality - there should be no zipper noise, aliasing should be dealt with in a reasonable manner, filters should respond as drawn, envelope times should be near standardized values (in the case of compressors near the 60% value) and in general the product should sound pleasing</li>
  <li>Ease of acquisition - if a product is difficult to download and install then it will not be included.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will only be considering <a href="#gratis">gratis</a>products that are both available on macOS and Windows. <strong>64-bit is a requirement</strong>. There will be no 32-bit products on this list for Mac OS or Windows. (unless I make a mistake of course‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>I will not list ‚Äúmagware‚Äù, which is software that only comes with the purchase of a magazine. Any product that requires purchase of any sort will not be listed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFree versions‚Äù with ridiculous limitations will not be listed. I will only list free versions of commercial products if they feel fully functional in their own right.</p>

<h2 id="x-and-y-plug-in-is-not-listed">X and Y plug-in is not listed!!</h2>

<p>Thank you for letting me know, this may have been an oversight. There may also be a chance that I simply do not feel that this plug-in is worth the time of attempting to use.</p>

<p>I do not aim to list every single free plug-in on this page. This plug-in list is only intended to list products that I feel are on par with commercial alternatives in some manner.</p>

<h2 id="no-but-really-x-plug-in-is-amazing-i-use-it-all-the-time">No, but really X plug-in is amazing! I use it all the time!</h2>

<p>If you told me about it than I gave it a second look, and if it is still not here and I‚Äôm sorry it will not be here unless it is updated in the future.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-free-mean">What does ‚Äúfree‚Äù mean?</h2>

<p>There are two common terms used, ‚Äúfree as in speech‚Äù and ‚Äúfree as in beer‚Äù. Let me clarify on my use of free:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Libre - ‚Äúfree as in speech‚Äù - these are products that are open source, which means that you are able in some manner to modify the product for your specific use as long as being permitted other freedoms by the license of the software. <strong>NOT ALL LIBRE SOFTWARE IS GRATIS</strong>. While you may be offered source code and liberties with the source, the author may still charge for their work. Be ethical and be responsible.</li>
  <li>Gratis - ‚Äúfree as in beer‚Äù - these products do not require payment to acquire. You may not be free to modify, distribute, copy or change the software in any way, but you can acquire the software and use it without paying for the opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The gratis section I will be judging much more harshly, because nobody except for the author has the ability to improve the software. Since you are put at the mercy of the author, who may not be maintaining the software at all, I must judge the software as if there is no potential for it to improvement at all.</p>

<p>Libre software has potential to be improved by you, or anyone else. Thusly I evaluate this software as having the potential to be excellent, but I still will only list things that I think are worth trying.</p>

<p><strong>If a product is both gratis and libre then it will be listed in the libre category.</strong></p>

<h2 id="lv2">LV2</h2>

<p><a href="http://lv2plug.in">LV2</a> is a plug-in format that has been primarily used by open source software, and you may be most familiar with that if you are a Linux DAW user.</p>

<p><a href="/music/2017/11/29/Run-LV2-plugins-on-macOS.html">It is possible to run LV2 plug-ins on macOS as I‚Äôve described here</a>.</p>

<p>Windows users‚Ä¶ sorry. I have no clue how you can easily utilize LV2 plug-ins without changing your DAW.</p>

<h1 id="libre">Libre</h1>

<p>These are effects that You can change to suit your preferences since you have access to the source code and you are allowed to modify it.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before I do not hold these to the same standard as I do with the gratis plug-ins, because you are free to modify these as you need.</p>

<p>I will only be forgiving issues with the GUI, these plug-ins must still sound as good as their gratis counterparts.</p>

<p><strong>NOT ALL OF THESE ARE GRATIS</strong>. Just because the source code is available and you may be offered freedom with it, that does not not mean that the author is not charging money for their work.</p>

  <li>VST

      <li><a href="https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova/">Nova</a> - This is both an equalizer and a dynamic equalizer. nova is a must-have for anybody, and the only reason you wouldn‚Äôt have it is if you own the <a href="https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova-ge/">gentleman‚Äôs edition</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://vladgsound.wordpress.com/plugins/nova67p/">Nova-67P</a> - this is the precursor to Nova, and it‚Äôs an interesting alternative. I prefer to use Nova in this case.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-vos-slickeq/">SlickEQ</a> - it took me a while to warm up to this product, but I now use the <a href="https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-vos-slickeq-ge/">gentleman‚Äôs addition</a> as my secondary most used EQ. Get it.</li>

  <li>VST

      <li><a href="http://www.yohng.com/software/w1limit.html">W1 Limiter</a> - this is not here because it sounds amazing, but because it is a great emulation of the Waves L1 limiter that is somehow loved by many people.</li>
      <li><a href="https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/DC1A/DC1A.php">DC1A</a> - I‚Äôm not in love with DC1A, but I am with its <a href="https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/DC8C/DC8C.php">big brother DC8C3</a>. Both are must haves, especially if you‚Äôre a dynamics geek.</li>
      <li><a href="https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/MJUCjr/MJUCjr.php">Mjuc Jr.</a> - <a href="https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/MJUC/MJUC.php">MJUC</a> was product of the year when it was released, and Mjuc Jr. is a must try.</li>

It‚Äôs possible to get a nearly identical sound with Kotelnikov, but with  more effort. I do prefer Kotelnikov * for master bus compression though.</li>
      <li><a href="https://d16.pl/frontier">Frontier</a> - I would not recommend this for final limiting, but used on various tracks it‚Äôs quite fun and versatile.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.alexhilton.net/A1AUDIO/index.php/a1triggergate">A1TriggerGate</a> - this is another excellent plug-in from Alex Hilton. It is a sequenced gate.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.audiodamage.com/pages/free-downloads">Rough Rider</a> - It‚Äôs ugly, it sounds ugly, but I used this thing a lot for years. Still fun.</li>

      <li><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/product/correlometer-by-voxengo">Correlometer</a> - This tells you the correlation between left and right channels, which also can correspond to ‚Äòstereo width‚Äô. It can be used for testing per-band correlation between two sources by routing the signals to the Left and Right channels of the plugin.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/mvmeter2.html">MvMeter2</a> - <a href="/music/2017/11/01/Gainstaging-for-the-modern-musician.html">as described in my Gain Staging post</a>, having a VU meter is useful (if not essential), and this is an excellent free one.</li>

<ul>
  <li>VST
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.softube.com/index.php?id=satknob">Saturation Knob</a> - decent saturation. It will alias, so I suggest not using on sources with a lot of high frequency content.</li>
      <li><a href="https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/IVGI/IVGI.php">IVGI</a> - My #1 free saturation module. This is the little brother of <a href="https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/SDRR/SDRR.php">SDRR</a> which is amazingly cheap and worth 10x the price.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.voxengo.com/product/tubeamp/">Tube Amp</a> - I delightfully easy to use tube emulation plug-in.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.tritik.com/products/krush/">Krush</a> - this is not a good sounding distortion, it‚Äôs a FSU (- stuff up) monster. A LOT of fun.</li>

<ul>
  <li>VST
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb">Tal-reverb</a> - not particularly useful for general work, but on synthesizers with long attack times it can sound neat.</li>
      <li><a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb-4">Tal-reverb-4</a> - less clingy sounding than the tal-reverb, this is more useful for general reverb needs.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/product/orilriver-by-denis-tihanov">Orilriver</a> - Orilriver is my favorite free VST reverb, and I like it so much that I often use it instead of many of my more expensive commercial reverb products.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.voxengo.com/product/oldskoolverb/">OldSkoolVerb</a> - OldSKoolVerb isn‚Äôt the best sounding reverb out there, but there‚Äôs been a number of records made with a very similar sound, so now it has its place in the production world. It can be a great sound design tool as well.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.smartelectronix.com/~magnus/">Ambience</a> - This is in the lineage of <a href="https://www.uvi.net/en/effects/sparkverb.html">SparkVerb</a>. It‚Äôs a fantastic free reverb.</li>

      <li><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/product/prof-e-t-by-ignite-amps">Pro F.E.T.</a> - this is a high gain stombox emulation, and I love using it on bass guitar, but it works fantastic in front of a digital amplifier for normal guitar.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.voxengo.com/product/boogex/">Boogex</a> - I was tempted to leave this off the list, because I rarely can get any good sounds out of it however I have heard some usable sounds made with it from other users so I have included it.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/product/emissary-by-ignite-amps">Emissary</a> - My favorite free guitar amp head. I‚Äôve used this on countless mixes despite having nearly every commercial guitar pack at my disposal.</li>

  <li>VST
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-ichiro-toda">synth1</a> - It is not the most technically competent synthesizer, but it is emulating a hardware synthesizer that is not particularly technically competent either. Many people love this product, and I would be remiss to not include it.</li>
      <li><a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-u-no-lx">tal-u-no-lx</a> - Juno 60 emulation. Excellent sounding.</li>

      <li><a href="https://u-he.com/products/triplecheese/">Triple Cheese</a> - barely passes muster for this list. It isn‚Äôt a technical marvel, but you can get some creative sounds out of this thing if you can stand to look at the GUI for long enough.</li>
      <li><a href="https://u-he.com/products/podolski/">Podolski</a> - another simple synthesizer with excellent sounds.</li>
      <li><a href="https://vcvrack.com">VCV Rack</a> - this is not a VST plug-in by itself, but it does have VST integration. You owe it to yourself to give VCV a try.</li>

      <li><a href="https://tytel.org/helm/">Helm</a> - this is simply the best free synthesizer on the market in my opinion. It is a must-have for any one that uses software synthesizers.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=486995">Ribs</a> - granular synthesis gone wild, download it.</li>

      <li><a href="http://hise.audio">HISE</a> - HSE is not for the faint of heart. It‚Äôs highly functional but mildly complex. The tradeoffs are worth it. It‚Äôs one of the few samplers that comes close to <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-6/pricing/">Kontakt</a> in terms of capability, and it‚Äôs free.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs/">Spitfire Audio Labs</a> - Neat collection of fairly simple, and intriguing instruments.</li>

      <li><a href="https://goodhertz.co/midside-matrix">Midside-Matrix</a> - another excellent mid-side plug-in, with a GUI that is slightly nicer than MSED.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mucoder.net/en/hypercyclic/">Hypercyclic</a> - maybe the best arpeggiator plug-in, and it‚Äôs free.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mucoder.net/en/tonespace/">tonespace</a> - awesome chord generator. If you want to eventuall upgrade from this then I suggest Scaler (not free)</li>

<p>Cutting threaded rod can be a pain. I‚Äôve seen all sorts of ways to hold it, cut it, prepared it etc‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs one way though that‚Äôs very simple, quick and reusable. Just make a split-nut.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how to do it‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Step 1. Put a nut in a vise that matches your threaded rod‚Äôs specs.</p>

<p>Step 2. Cut a slot in it. I‚Äôm using a dremel tool here. You can use a hacksaw or jigsaw (if you hold the nut differently), or even a file.</p>

<p>Note: I suggest against using a diamond disc like I am in this photo. The carbon from the diamond and heat from the friction will cause hardening of the steel. It‚Äôs possible to end up with a nut that is very difficult to close. It seems like a small deal, but it‚Äôs happened to me.</p>

<p>Use a proper cut-off wheel and <strong>good safety goggles</strong>.</p>

<p>Step 3. Use the thing. Slip the nut(s) on the threaded rod, orient them so when the vise closes the nut clamps the rod.</p>

<p>Step 4. Do whatever. Now you can safely cut your rod with a hacksaw or dremel or jigsaw or whatever. A quick file once it‚Äôs cut and you are done.</p>

<p>I keep a set of magnets on my bandsaw stand. I just toss my split nuts on those magnets so they are always at hand when I need them.</p>

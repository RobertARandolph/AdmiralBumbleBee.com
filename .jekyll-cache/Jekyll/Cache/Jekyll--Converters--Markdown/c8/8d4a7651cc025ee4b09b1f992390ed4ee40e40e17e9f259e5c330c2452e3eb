<p>I received a very neat vintage scrub plane for Christmas. This type of plane has a heavily cambered blade which allows you to work across or diagonally to the grain. The camber allows the blade to both dig in the center while the upswing scores the edges to reduce tearout.</p>

<p>The grind on the blade was very poor, so I corrected it while attempting to remove as little metal as possible. The resulting look of the grind is not fantastic, but to correct it ‘for looks’ would require removing much more metal. This would reduce the life of the plane by many years.</p>

<p>Here’s some more pictures of the process and plane.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s time for another DAW Chart!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve spent some time thinking about how I had this setup. Having experienced DAWs that are deficient in some areas, and learning the wonders of other features, Iâ€™ve re-evaluated what I feel is important. Thereâ€™s features that Iâ€™ve come to rely on heavily in Reaper, and some features Iâ€™ve realized (analytically) that I donâ€™t use as often as I thought.</p>

<p>My time spent in each DAW as a percentage, according to <a href="https://manytricks.com/timesink/">Time Sink</a> has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaper - 61%</li>
  <li>DP - 39%</li>
</ul>

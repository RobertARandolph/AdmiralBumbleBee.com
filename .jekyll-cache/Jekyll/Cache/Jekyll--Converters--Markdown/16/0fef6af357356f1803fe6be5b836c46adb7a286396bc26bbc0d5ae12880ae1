That’s what I’m going to cover because I was asked by Lorenz at <a href="http://www.xarcmastering.com">Xarc Mastering</a>.</p>

<p>The Melda system is quite feature-filled, so I’m going to be splitting this review in to 2 parts: Part 1 (this) and Part 2 (coming soon!). Part 1 is going to cover features that are common between the 3 products, and other Melda plugins. Part 2 is going to cover the unique functionality of the 3 products.</p>

<p>I will also be comparing <a href="https://www.meldaproduction/Mfreeformanalogeq">MFreeformAnalogEQ</a> and <a href="https://www.meldaproduction.com/MFreeformEqualizer">MFreeFormEqualizer</a> to <a href="/music/2018/05/01/Harrison-AVA-Mastering-EQ-investigation.html">Harrison AVA Mastering EQ</a>.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out <a href="/music/2018/05/17/Melda-Freeform-Part-2.html">Part 2 as well!</a></p>

<p>Without further ado… let’s see what these plugins have in common.</p>

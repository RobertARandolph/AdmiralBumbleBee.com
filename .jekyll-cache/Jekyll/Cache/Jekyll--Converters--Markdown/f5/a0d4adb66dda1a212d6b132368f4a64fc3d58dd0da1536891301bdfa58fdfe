<p>In this post Iâ€™m going to evaluate all of the included effects and instruments in Studio One. I wonâ€™t be covering the presets, samples or loops, since I never use those.</p>

<p>As the scale you see indicates, this is what the ratings mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1-3: I would never use this in a project. Thereâ€™s something better regardless of your platform that is cheap or free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4-6: This is probably replaceable by something relatively expensive or it is marginally useful because of some unique feature or integration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7-9: I would use this at any reasonable opportunity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>10: I would find reasons to use this.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So hereâ€™s how I feel about <strong>all</strong> of the built in effects in Studio One</p>

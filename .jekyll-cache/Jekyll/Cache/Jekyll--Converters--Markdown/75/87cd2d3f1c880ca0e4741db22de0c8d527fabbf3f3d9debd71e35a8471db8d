<p>Just opening up Ardour and starting a basic session, I‚Äôve noticed quite a few things. So here‚Äôs my first impressions, both positive and negative.</p>

<p>Note that I am using the nightly OS X version, built locally.</p>

<h1 id="project-creation">Project creation</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Project creation is quite good to start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Audio Connections Manager is great for setting up routing. Much faster than other DAW‚Äôs methods.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>

<p>Performance appears to be <em>extremely</em> poor compared to any other DAW on this system. Running at 64 sample buffer at 44.1khz sample rate with 6 tracks yields frequent x-runs. I can run at 64sample buffer at 96khz in DP/Cubase/Logic with dozens of tracks and plug-ins running without any issue.</p>

<p>This may require more investigating, but if this is actually correct then I may stop this review early.</p>

<h1 id="uiux">UI/UX</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many windows don‚Äôt abide by the cmd-w shortcut to close windows. <em>Very annoying</em>. (edit: This is getting fixed. Yay IRC!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some windows don‚Äôt close when clicking the red X in the title bar! What?! (edit: This is getting fixed. Yay IRC!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Windows don‚Äôt respond to Cmd-`. Ugh, again. (edit: This is getting fixed. Yay IRC!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall look of the UI seems rather unpleasant. Spacing around fonts is inconsistent, buttons are varying sizes, rounded buttons corner widgets are weird looking, button spacing is inconsistent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tooltips are inconsistent: Some have bindings listed, some don‚Äôt. Many are written in different styles with different spacing/sizing.</p>

    <p>Bindings (shortcuts) should <em>always</em> be listed on tooltips.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some missing bindings that IMO should be standard: grid snap, deselect, change track height, and a few others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Browsing bindings requires expanding various categories to see everything. Rather annoying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>SO MANY</em> always on top windows that don‚Äôt respond correctly to common methods of closing windows.</p>

    <p>Always on top windows are on top of <strong><em>EVERYTHING</em></strong>. Including other apps. (edit: this is a bug apparently)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meters are very responsive and have good default ballistics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall the UI is very responsive and fast.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="audio-editing">Audio editing</h1>

<p>Audio editing <em>appears</em> to be very good, at least concerning what I am used to.</p>

<h1 id="plug-in-support">Plug-in support</h1>

<p>Ardour is the <em>first</em> DAW that I‚Äôve used which successfully scans <strong>ALL</strong> of my plug-ins without error. Impressive.</p>

<h1 id="manual">Manual</h1>

<p>The manual is incomplete, very poorly formatted and uses an awful font for technical writing. Of course this can be fixed‚Ä¶ but the current state is poor.</p>

<h1 id="support">Support</h1>

<p>Being able to speak directly with the developers on freenode.net is <em>amazing</em>. They are very helpful, thorough and communicate clearly.</p>

<p>Likewise being able to browse the sourcecode is extremely valuable. I can‚Äôt overstate how useful this is. Despite any other shortcomings, this point makes up for <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<h1 id="routing">Routing</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ardour has some very cool routing abilities. Anything to anywhere, even if it‚Äôs stupid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Audio Connection Manager for assigning track inputs is very nice. Way better than clicking input/output buttons for each track. <em>Way better</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mixer">Mixer</h1>

<p>I already love the mixer in Ardour!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inline effects are AWESOME.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easy selection of metering point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many metering options, selectable by track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meters are very responsive and quick.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-skeuomorphic fader. Very easy to see the fader levels and manipulate it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mousewheel on the fader works very cleanly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit plugin with generic controls is actually rather useful. I like having that option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pan/balance for stereo channels is very well implemented.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No mixer Undo :(</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easily scriptable with Lua. Easy. If you are using a DAW, you can probably figure this stuff out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="lua-bindings">Lua bindings</h1>

<p>I usually <em>hate</em> having to make macros and scripts. The <a href="http://manual.ardour.org/lua-scripting/brain_dump/">Lua bindings</a> in Ardour are very cool. I‚Äôve managed to make some very useful things with it so far, and easily ‚Äúfix‚Äù some missing functions.</p>

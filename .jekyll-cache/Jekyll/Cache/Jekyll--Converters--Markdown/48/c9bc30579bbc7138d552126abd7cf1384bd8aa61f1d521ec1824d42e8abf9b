<p>If you’re a longtime reader you may recognize the image above. This post is just some text discussion about me, my DAW choices and how I feel about these three products:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaper</li>
  <li>Digital Performer</li>
  <li>Cubase</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a longtime Digital Performer user, and added Reaper to my arsenal a <a href="/music/2017/04/22/30-days-of-Reaper-come-to-an-end.html">while back</a>. Things are changing though.</p>

<p>Spare me a moment to rant.</p>

<p>(Yes, that’s my eye)</p>

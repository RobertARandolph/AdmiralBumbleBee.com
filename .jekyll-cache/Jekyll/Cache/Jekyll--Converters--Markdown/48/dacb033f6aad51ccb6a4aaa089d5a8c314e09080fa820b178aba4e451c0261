<p>I have a 1965 Ludwig Supraphonic snare drum and when I purchased some new <a href="http://www.puresoundpercussion.com/PSPProductDetails.Page?AxPageID=6211&amp;mode=0&amp;productid=9&amp;ActiveID=4896&amp;productname=Custom_Pro">Puresound Custom Pro 20 Strand Snare Wires</a> I had issues. Buzzing, slippage and inconsistent tension were plaguing me.</p>

<p>After searching the net for how to tie the snare strainer side, I realized there was no good info out there!</p>

<p>I tried dozens of methods, followed by lots of testing, and came up with what seems to be the best methodâ€¦</p>

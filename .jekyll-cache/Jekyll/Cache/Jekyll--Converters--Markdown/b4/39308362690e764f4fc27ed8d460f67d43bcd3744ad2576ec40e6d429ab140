<p>Perhaps you remember <a href="/music/2017/11/24/A-tale-of-amazing-customer-interaction.html">my previous post about Sonimus’s fantastic customer interaction</a>. Well recently, on the same subject even, another company has stepped up: <a href="http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/index.html">TBProAudio</a>.</p>

<p>On the 5th of December <a href="http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html">ISOL8 was released by TBProAudio</a>. It was discussed on a few social services I use, and a number of people commented about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">perspective projection</a> render.</p>

<p>So I e-mailed TBProAudio.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello. I was just made aware of your new free product http://tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html</p>

  <p>I know it is not in good taste to complain about a free product, but I thought I should drop you a note. I run a music chat server with 4000+ active users (discord.gg/edmp) and some folks were &gt; recently talking about isol8. A number of users immediately complained that the GUI made them feel nauseous or seasick.</p>

  <p>Another developer recently had a backlash about this here: https://www.gearslutz.com/board/new-product-alert/1187003-sonimus-releases-stoneq-4k-satson-series-equalizer-2.html and they &gt; responded very well. They changed the rendering mode from perspective to an orthographic render and many users were very happy.</p>

  <p>I don’t know how many people would take the time to e-mail you about this, I think most people would simply just not use the product. So I’m alerting you to this issue in case you are &gt; interested in addressing it.</p>

  <p>Thank you for releasing a great free product!</p>

<p>TBProAudio responded in about 9 hours with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello Robert,</p>

  <p>thank you for the hint! I´m not affected, but i got the point. I will talk to my GUI designer:-)</p>

  <p>regards 
TBProAudio</p>

<p>Today, the 11th of December, I received an e-mail from TBProAudio</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello Robert,</p>

  <p>OK, we got the message :-)  We just release V1.0.1 and changed GUI to orthographic rendering.
Just to let you know…</p>

  <p>regards 
TBProAudio</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>AWESOME!</strong>. It’s quite the rarity for developers to respond to changes in GUI based on feedback, especially so quickly. <a href="http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html">ISOL8</a> now has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection">orthographic render</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve not spend much time using <a href="http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/index.html">TBProAudio</a> products, however I sure will give them all a shot now!</p>

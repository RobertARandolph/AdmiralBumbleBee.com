<p>A while ago I <a href="/music/2017/02/11/Drumstick-modification.html">wrote a post about modifying your drumsticks</a> to help them last longer. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpEfTfyw6G4">I also have a video on the topic using another method</a> that <em>any</em> drummer can execute, even on store-bought sticks without any tools.</p>

<p>It really will make your drumsticks last longer, sound better and get you all the ladies (guys).</p>

<p>Let me show you the results and benefits of the modification.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Modification to the modification</div>

<p>Since the original post, I‚Äôve started shaving one side of the nub. So the stick does not have a nub <em>all the way</em> around the stick, but instead there‚Äôs a light flat at one point. My thumb rests on the flat, and the nub falls between my index and middle fingers.</p>

<p>This helps me not rotate the stick while playing, and is a big part of this post. See the image above.</p>

<p>This modification to the modification was present during testing, and I‚Äôve been using this change literally since the day of the <a href="/music/2017/02/11/Drumstick-modification.html">original post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpEfTfyw6G4">The method in this video</a> prevents rotation as well, so you‚Äôre save with that method.</p>

<p>The upper stick is a drum stick I made from the same piece of ash, directly adjacent on the tree to the stick below.</p>

<p>The lower stick is modified with the ‚Äònub‚Äô that controls both the striking <strong>side</strong> of the stick and the fulcrum of the stick. Both of these increase tonal consistency and longevity of the stick.</p>

<p>I played in 4 minute sections of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NF1bYgHnZs">exact same looped song</a>. After the song ended I switched the sticks in each hand.</p>

<p>The track was played through 5 times per stick configuration for 10 total plays and 41 minutes and 10 seconds of playing.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Sticks up close</div>

<p>Let‚Äôs break down the differences between the sticks.</p>

<h2 id="unmodified-stick">Unmodified stick</h2>

<p>The upper stick is unmodified. The stick freely moves while playing both rotationally and along the length.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The wood is dented around the circumference of the stick</li>
  <li>There are significant detents in the stick extending 5‚Äù/13cm from the tip</li>
  <li>The resulting taper is consistent</li>
  <li>There is consistent chipping along the shoulder. On location (unshown) has a large chip of wood missing</li>
  <li>The diameter of the stick 1‚Äù/2.5cm from the edge was reduced 0.031‚Äù/0.8mm from the starting size.</li>
  <li>The tip is clearly worn and missing a light chip (unshown)</li>
  <li>Stick slipped twice out of my hand while playing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modified-stick">Modified stick</h2>

<p>The lower stick is <a href="/music/2017/02/11/Drumstick-modification.html">modified</a>. The stick does not rotate while playing and does not shift in the hand along the length</p>

<ul>
  <li>The wood is dented on only the striking side of the stick</li>
  <li>Significant detents on the stick extend 2‚Äù/5cm from the tip</li>
  <li>The resulting taper is asymmetrical. Only the striking side has a light concave taper.</li>
  <li>Very light chipping only on the striking side</li>
  <li>The diameter of the stick 1‚Äù/2.5cm from the edge was reduced 0.020‚Äù/0.5mm from the starting size.</li>
  <li>Tip is in excellent condition</li>
  <li>No issues with stick grip</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>The unmodified stick clearly shows more damage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The detents in the wood are offset which weaken the structure considerably (think about how you chop down a tree with offset entry points).</li>
  <li>There was more reduction in diameter on the unmodified stick.</li>
  <li>The unmodified stick had more grain lifting and a chip lost.</li>
</ul>

<p>The modified stick‚Äôs wear pattern creates a light concavity from the consistent striking on 1 face. This concave shape is intuitively stronger than a consistent taper around the stick.</p>

<p>As the stick deteriorates the concave pattern also yields slightly along the side opposing the concavity. The feel of the stick changes noticeably and you can frequently changes sticks before a catastrophic breakage.</p>

<p>An un-tangible aspect of the test was that I felt I had much more control over the modified stick. I believe this is largely due to having a consistently located grip while playing.</p>

<h2 id="wear-profile-explanation">Wear Profile explanation</h2>

  <img src="/assets/DrumSticks/Profile.png" alt="Profile">
  <div class="image-caption">Profile wear</div>

<p>Here you can see more clearly the type of wear each stick has.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Modified - The stick does <em>not</em> rotate and developes a single-sided concavity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unmodified - The stick rotates in the hand in use causing a rotationally symmetrical concavity to form around the whole stick</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the modified stick wears, it develops a consistent one-sided curve that increases it‚Äôs relative strength compared to a rotationally symmetrical reduction of diameter.</p>

<p>Hopefully with the image it‚Äôs intuitively clear how the Modified stick is stronger given the same taper and diameter through the wearing process.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>At the very least, I believe that it‚Äôs fairly certain that the stick modification increases the longevity of the sticks fairly significantly.</p>

<p>I already know this since my modified sticks often last <em>months</em> and unmodified last a few weeks at best, but I found it interesting how quickly the differences visually became apparent.</p>

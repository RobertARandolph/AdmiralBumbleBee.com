<p>Using a product like Cubase has really had my mind turning. The idea of having to <strong>deeply</strong> learn a new program as well as I know DP (or PT or SAW) is painful. There is also the fact that Cubase has its own weaknesses in areas that interest me.</p>

<p>So to help gather my thoughts, I thought that I should make a list of some nice things that would make the ideal DAW for me. It only makes sense to list the ‘dealbreakers’ as well.</p>

<p>So here we go!</p>

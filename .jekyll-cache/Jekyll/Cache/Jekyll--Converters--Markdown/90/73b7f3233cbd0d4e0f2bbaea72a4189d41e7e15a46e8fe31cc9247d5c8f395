<p>I see this damn thing all the time. It wouldnâ€™t be a big deal except Iâ€™ve had Studio One crash <em>while saving</em> and corrupt the save file. Not exactly professional behaviour, but it is exceptionally frustrating. At least it fits in with a lot of my other S1 experiences thusfar.</p>

<p>They are fixing issues relatively frequently, but so far this has been the most unstable DAW that Iâ€™ve used. I also get the feeling like Iâ€™m squeezed for performance with Studio One, but I have no concrete data yet.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently in OS X 10.11.5, with no such issues in other DAWs.</p>

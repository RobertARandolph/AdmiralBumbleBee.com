<p><a href="https://www.presonus.com/products/Studio-One/whats-new">Studio One 4</a> has been released and Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a lot of folks expecting me to do a 30 days with it, or an exhaustive review.</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t be doing that. I did have a post half-prepared, but as I was working on fleshing it out and doing some extra research, I realized that thereâ€™s people out there with great content on this already.</p>

<p>So what Iâ€™m going to do is list some content that I think is great, then go over some things that I particularly like/dislike. This wonâ€™t be a <em>complete</em> review.</p>

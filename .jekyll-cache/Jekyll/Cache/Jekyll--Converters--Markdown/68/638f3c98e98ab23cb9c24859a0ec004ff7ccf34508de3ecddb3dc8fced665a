<p>If you are not familiar with how DAWs like <a href="http://www.avid.com/pro-tools">Pro Tools</a> and <a href="http://motu.com/products/software/dp">Digital Performer</a> handle editing multiple tracks at once, let me explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You select some tracks.</li>
  <li>You add them to a group</li>
  <li>Optionally setup <em>what</em> is grouped about them (DP has fantastic options for this)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now when you make an edit to a single track that is in an <em>active</em> group, the same edit happens to everything else in that group. Groups can be turned on/off at will quite easily.</p>

<p>Reaper does things quite differently, and I find it to be a pain. But thereâ€™s a workaround (more like an alternate workflow) that I think is better in some caseâ€¦</p>

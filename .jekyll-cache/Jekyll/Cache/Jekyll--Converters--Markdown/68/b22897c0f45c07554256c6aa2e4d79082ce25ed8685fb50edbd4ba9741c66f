<p>I have an <a href="http://daddario.com/EvProductDetail.Page?ActiveID=3567&amp;productid=448&amp;productname=Torque_Key&amp;sid=4ffafe7e-f537-4d66-ac5e-b34e5a458468">Evans Torque Key</a> that I’ve been testing for a couple months for attempting to quickly maintain drum tuning. While the actual product itself is great, the concept that it is based on is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>I’m going to cover both the product and the issues that underlie its failure as a product.</p>

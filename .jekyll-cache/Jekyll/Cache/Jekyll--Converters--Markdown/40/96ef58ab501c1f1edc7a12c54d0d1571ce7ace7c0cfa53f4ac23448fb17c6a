<p>Editing multitrack drums something that not many people do, but thatâ€™s what this post is about today.</p>

<p>Actually, scratch that. This is about quantizing any audio in a manner that offers you the best possible sound, but it is most noticeable with drums.</p>

<p>Not only am I going to show you how to do this method manually, but I am going to demonstrate a script that does this for you automatically.</p>

<p>This process will work in nearly any DAW that allows you to stretch or warp audio.</p>

<p>It’s time for the post that everyone seems to love: when I talk about the stuff I dislike about a DAW.</p>

<p>First things first: If you see anything that’s wrong or know of a <em>great</em> work around then <strong>please leave a comment</strong>. I will gladly update the post with the information if it’s good.</p>

<p>There won’t be too many images here, so be prepared for a bit of reading and not many eye-catching screenshots. I’ve split things in to categories as well so that you can see the portions that are of most interest to you.</p>

<p>These grips apply to Logic 10.4. I wrote a good portion of this before 10.4, but I tried to make sure I erased anything that was improved with the update. If I missed something then that’s mea culpa, so please correct me.</p>

<p><strong>Oh right, and this is the last post in the series</strong>! My ultimate conclusion is at the end!</p>

<p>Let’s get on it.</p>

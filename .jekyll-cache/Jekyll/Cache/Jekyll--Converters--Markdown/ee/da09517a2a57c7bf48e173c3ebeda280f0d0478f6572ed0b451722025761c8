<p><a href="http://motu.com/products/software/dp/">Digital Performer 10 is out!</a> and one of the big features is VCA faders. Other DAWs have had them for a while, but I love DP and itâ€™s now time to talk about VCA Faders in more detail.</p>

<p>What are VCA faders and why do they matter? Allow me a few minutes to explain.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart</a> has been updated for DP10! Look at those points soar!</p>

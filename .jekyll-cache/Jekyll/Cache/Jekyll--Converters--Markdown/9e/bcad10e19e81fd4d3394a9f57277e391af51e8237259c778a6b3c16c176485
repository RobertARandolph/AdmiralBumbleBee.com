<p>Originally I wanted to frame this as an objective review, but it became clear as I was writing it is that I simply was being far too positive about this product.</p>

<p>So what I present to you here today is my favorite product of 2018; <a href="https://www.eareckon.com/en/products/earevolve-stereo-chorus-rotary-speaker-plugin.html">EARevolve by EAReckon</a>.</p>

<p>I think that many people may not see this as a useful plug-in to have in their arsenal, however this is an incredibly useful plug-in that I think anybody will find to be an invaluable part of their plug-in collection.</p>

<p>Rather than just say all this garbage, how about I try and convince you…</p>

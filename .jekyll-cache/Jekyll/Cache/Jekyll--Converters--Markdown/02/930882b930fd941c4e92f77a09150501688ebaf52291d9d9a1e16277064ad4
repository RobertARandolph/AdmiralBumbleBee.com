I"^<p>I have made some updates to the <a href="/ReaperScripts.html">REAPER script showcase</a> and to the <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Chart</a>.</p>

<p>More importantly I have decided that I need to update the site only once every weekend, rather than every 4 days as I’ve done for nearly 2 years. I have started doing videos for nearly every single post and the posts have become more in-depth and time-consuming to write.</p>

<p>I will continue to try to have videos every single week and a new post every week accompanying it. There will still be small posts in between occasionally, but the big post will come out on the weekend along with videos.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas for content, or if there’s something you’re struggling with that you’d like me to explore then please send me an e-mail. I use gmail and my name is <code class="highlighter-rouge">audiolabs</code>.</p>

<p>If you haven’t taken the time to <a href="/DonateNow/">Donate</a> or become a <a href="http://patreon.com/admiralbumblebee">Patreon</a> then please consider it. I take between 20 and 40 hours per week  creating some of this content. That is time that I could be using to earn extra money or enjoy hobbies without needing to log every aspect of what I’m doing, but instead I present this information on my website entirely free.</p>

<p>This site will never have ads or affiliate links or any other sneaky ways of me trying to take your money or profit off of your existence. Instead I ask that you voluntarily support these efforts.</p>

<p>If you cannot afford to support the site monetarily, then simply commenting on articles means a great deal to me. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/admiralbumblebee">If you can subscribe to my Youtube channel</a> then that will help me eventually begin to monetize that avenue of information delivery (with ads).</p>

<p>Thank you everyone!</p>

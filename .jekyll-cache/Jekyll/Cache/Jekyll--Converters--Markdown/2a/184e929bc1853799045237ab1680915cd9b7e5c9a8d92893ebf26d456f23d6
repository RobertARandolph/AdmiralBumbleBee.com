I"@<p>I’ve made some fairly major backend updates to the website. <strong>MUCH BETTER</strong> mobile experience, more responsive site layout, improved side bars (which I’ll make use of later), better text formatting and more.</p>

<p>I’ve also updated the DAW chart with a few new categories and much better formatting.</p>

<p>I’ve removed the experimental ‘Mixing Services’ service as well. The intent was to provide lower-cost mixing services to musicians that may benefit from less thorough mixing services. The result was me doing <strong>far</strong> more work for much less money. It was an interesting experiment while it lasted, but I’m back to my previous rates. E-mail me (as usual) at audiolabs via gmail for any information.</p>

<p>Please let me know if anything is broken in the comments, thank you!</p>

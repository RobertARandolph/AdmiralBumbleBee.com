<p><a href="https://kilohearts.com">Kilohearts</a> is known for their <a href="https://kilohearts.com/products/snap_heap">Snap Heap</a> product, which is quite is perhaps another review in itself, though it will feature here.</p>

<p>They released two Equalizer products a time back: <a href="https://kilohearts.com/products/carve_eq">Carve</a> and <a href="https://kilohearts.com/products/slice_eq">Slice</a>.</p>

<p>There will only be cursory testing of the DSP itself to make sure it’s operating as presented in the GUI… unless I find something interesting.</p>

<p>I will be mostly focusing on the workflow in Carve and Slice, along with the Snap Heap integration.</p>

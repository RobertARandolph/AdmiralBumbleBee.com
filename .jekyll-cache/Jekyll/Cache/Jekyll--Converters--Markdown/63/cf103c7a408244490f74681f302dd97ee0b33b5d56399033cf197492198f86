<p>Some people love sharpening. Some people hate it. I like it, but there‚Äôs no reason to spend more time doing it than necessary.</p>

<p>If you use water stones then there is a way to reduce time spent on each stone and improve the feeling of moving the steel across the stone.</p>

<p>Click through for how, and some testing!</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Simple Green Concentrate</div>

<p><a href="http://simplegreen.com/products/all-purpose-cleaner/">This is how you do it.</a>. Simple green concentrate.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant">surfactant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion">emulsifier</a>. The mechanism of action that I propose helps with the process is that it first better suspends the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarf">swarf</a> in the liquid lubricant (water) then helps carry this emultation away. This seems to allow you to spend more time contacting the steel with the abrasive, than steel to the swarf.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve used Simple Green previously on/off in a spray bottle. It was totally an accident since I had 2 identical bottles in my shop: one water, one simple green. I noticed a few times that sharpening was much faster sometimes, and it took me a few months to realize I‚Äôd been accidentally grabbing the Simple Green bottle. The difference in speed and feel was rather obvious, so I did some light testing. I‚Äôve been using Simple Green ever since.</p>

<p>Now I‚Äôm doing some not-so-light testing.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">The station</div>

<p>So this is my sharpening station. <a href="/workshop/2017/03/17/Sharpening-Station.html">I covered it before</a>. It‚Äôs a cabinet with a place for stones, then a water pump underneath.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">The Bucket'o'stuff</div>

<p>This is the liquid supply. I change it after every cycle. The water is recycled through a filter as it drains back in.</p>

<h1 id="the-test">The Test</h1>

<p>The test is simple. I am using a <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?cat=1,43072,43078&amp;p=51868">Veritas Honing Guide</a> with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neiko-02628A-Carving-Chisel-9-Piece/dp/B003X5KF04">Neiko Chisel</a>. (<a href="/workshop/2016/03/29/chisel-testing.html">See more about those chisels here</a>).</p>

<p>I will do multiple cycles where I start sharpening on a <a href="https://www.shapton.com/traditional-series">Shapton Traditional #220</a> up to a Shapton Traditional #12,000. (#1000, #5000, #8000, #12,000) I will flatten each stone for each cycle with a <a href="https://www.dmtsharp.com/sharpeners/bench-stones/dia-sharp/">DMT Diasharp Coarse</a>.</p>

<p>I will change the lubricant from Water to 1:100 Simple Green:Water on each total cycle. The number of strokes required to remove the scratches of the previous grit will be recorded.</p>

<p>I will wipe and check the chisel every 5 strokes and assess if the previous grit‚Äôs scratch marks have been removed.</p>

<p>The bevel angle is 25¬∞. The width is 1/2‚Äù (12.7mm). The steel is Chrome Vanadium.</p>

<p>This is what the #220 scratch pattern looks like.</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Where we end each cycle</div>

<p>This is what the #12,000 scratch pattern looks like. A mirror finish. Sharp as you could ever want.</p>

<p>This took me nearly 5 hours to do. It‚Äôs a lot of work!</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>The conclusion is pretty easy at this point. Adding Simple Green to your water when using water stones is %169 faster or better!</p>

<p>Ideally I should do more tests, and double blind, but the difference is massive. There‚Äôs also no way to do a legitimate blind test since the feel of the steel on the stone is so different. When using Simple Green, the feel starts out rough and slowly changes to a smooth feeling with the occasional scratchy feeling. When using water, it‚Äôs mostly a scratchy feeling with the occasional sensation of the steel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaplaning">hydroplaning</a> on the stone.</p>

<p>I did not record the #220 stage, but it was by far the most noticeable. There‚Äôs something about that stone that is rather different from the others. The Simple Green makes a <strong>HUGE</strong> difference. Sometimes with just water the #220 will glaze over and start polishing instead of grinding. That never happened with the Simple Green in the water.</p>

<p>Add Simple Green to your water stone water. It really helps!</p>

<h1 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait! There‚Äôs more!</h1>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.boratool.com/hone-right-gold-250ml">HoneRite</a> in a spray bottle on my #12,000 stone usually. HoneRite causes the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/whet">whetting</a> process to act similarly to the Simple Green, but with the added benefit of making the water not cause rust on the tool (as quickly).</p>

<p>HoneRite is too expensive to use in my bucket, since I change that water frequently.</p>

<p>I did try some Simple Green with HoneRite and the result was a very slick/smooth feeling when moving the steel across the stone. Is it better? I don‚Äôt know. I see no reason to test it at this point.</p>

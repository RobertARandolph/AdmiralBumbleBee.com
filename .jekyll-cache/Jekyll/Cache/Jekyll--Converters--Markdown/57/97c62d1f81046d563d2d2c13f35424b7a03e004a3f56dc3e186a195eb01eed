<p>42 plugins I counted. I think that’s right… That’s what you get with the <a href="https://marketplace.tracktion.com/shop/tracktion-waveform-9-ultimate.html">Waveform Ultimate</a> bundle. 41 in Waveform+ and there’s 24 (I think) in the Basic version.</p>

<p>So it’s time for the part of the DAW review where I spend a ridiculous amount of time testing and doing reviews of every single plugin that’s included. Each plugin will have one of 3 labels on it that indicate my overall review of the plugin, along with my commentary. Here’s what the labels mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fantastic</strong> - These are plugins that I think would be an excellent value to purchase if possible. Likewise, they compare favourably with third-party plugins on the market.</li>
  <li><strong>Sufficient</strong> - Sufficient get the job done without much hassle. There may be no fancy extra features like some third-party competitors, or maybe the DAW version is missing some common feature, but nevertheless it’s enough to get the job done.</li>
  <li><strong>Flawed</strong> or <strong>Replace</strong> - As the name implies, these plugins have some sort of flaw or they are so limited that they can be replaced by a better solution. I will only use the ‘Replace’ option if I explicitly know of a free multi-platform (mac/win, sorry Linux dudes) option that I think is better.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to recognize that <a href="#Biotek">Biotek</a> and <a href="#daw-essentials-collection">The DAW Essentials Collection</a> come as VST/AU/AAX/Linux VST. <a href="#master-mix">Master Mix</a> is available as an external plugin, but that does not appear to come with Waveform Ultimate.</p>

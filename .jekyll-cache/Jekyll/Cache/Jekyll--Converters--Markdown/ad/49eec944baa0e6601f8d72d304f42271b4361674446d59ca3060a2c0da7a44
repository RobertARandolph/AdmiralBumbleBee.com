<p><a href="https://neuraldsp.com/products/darkglass-ultra-plugins/">NeuralDSP released emulations</a> of the <a href="https://www.darkglass.com/creations/vintage-ultra-v2/">Darkglass Vintage Ultra</a> and <a href="https://www.darkglass.com/creations/microtubes-b7k-ultra-v2/">B7K Ultra</a> this year and Iâ€™ve yet to see anyone do a real <strong>proper</strong> review of them.</p>

<p>In this review Iâ€™m going to assume that you already know that the <a href="https://www.darkglass.com/creations/vintage-ultra-v2/">Darkglass Vintage Ultra</a> and <a href="https://www.darkglass.com/creations/microtubes-b7k-ultra-v2/">B7K Ultra</a> are awesome. <strong>They are</strong>.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™m going to cover here is whether or not the plugin version lives up to kings of bass pedals.</p>

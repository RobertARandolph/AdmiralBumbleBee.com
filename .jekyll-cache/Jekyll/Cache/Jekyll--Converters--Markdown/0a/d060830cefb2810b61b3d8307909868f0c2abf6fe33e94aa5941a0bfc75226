<p>You may have heard of <a href="https://www.tracktion.com/products/t6-daw">Tracktion</a> before, since it’s been around for the last 17 years or so.</p>

<p>I personally was a <strong>huge</strong> fan of Tracktion, around version 1 and 2, for doing my own personal music work. Tracktion was then purchased by <a href="http://mackie.com">Mackie</a> around version 3. In my view, Tracktion was totally ruined during this period. It became buggy, feature additions were limited and communication with the community was reduced to basically nothing. I don’t know what transpired behind the scenes, but it was unfortunate.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://mackie.com/blog/tracktion-has-new-home">Tracktion V4</a>, ownership was gained by the original author along with some others great folks. Development ramped up again. Many new features were added. <a href="https://roli.com/article/roli-welcomes-juce-2">Roli acquired JUCE</a>, which is the library that makes up the core of Tracktion/Waveform. There’s a strong core behind Tracktion in 2018.</p>

<p>Here we are at version 9 now. Tracktion is no longer the name of the software. Tracktion is the company that makes the software which is now named <code class="highlighter-rouge">Waveform</code>. I’ve avoided reviewing Tracktion or Waveform for the last few years because I feared that I would need to do a ‘side review’. A side review is where I only use the software aside my main DAW, much like how I did the <a href="/tags/#Bitwig">Bitwig review</a>. I rather try to use the DAW for at least 30 days as my <em>main software</em>, but I can only do that if the software offers a bare minimum of capabilities that I require.</p>

<p>I think that Tracktion Waveform 9 has managed to cross the line of ‘daily driver’ for me.</p>

<p>For the next 30 days <a href="/music/2018/02/04/Things-I-hate-about-Logic-Pro-X.html#conclusion">or more</a> I will be using Tracktion Waveform 9 as my main DAW. I’m unsure how I’m going to format this review yet, since I want to try something new, but you will definitely see the full effects/instruments reviews and the in-depth content that I always try to provide.</p>

<p>Waveform is a rather unique product and I think that this will be an interesting adventure. It will be even more interesting since I’m taking delivery of various products to upgrade my computer, <a href="https://us.focusrite.com/thunderbolt-audio-interfaces/clarett-8prex">a new interface</a>, more preamps, more microphones, more outboard, new monitor control, more monitors and some fun audio software in the next few weeks too!</p>

<p><strong>I did not pay for this copy of Waveform 9</strong>. It was provided as ‘free’ not-for-resale review copy. If I am happy with the product I will be purchasing a license for my own personal use at the end of this review. The NFR nature of the license will not influence my judgments in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>Hopefully the first post will be up in the next 3 days. I have a lot of work to do in the next 2 days!</p>

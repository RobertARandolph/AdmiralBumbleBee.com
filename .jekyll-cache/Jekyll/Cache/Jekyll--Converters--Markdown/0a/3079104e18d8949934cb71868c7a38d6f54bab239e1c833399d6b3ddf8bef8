<p>Why pay upwards of $50 for a mic adapter for a tom?</p>

<p>Made in less than 5 minutes with 2 bolts, a wingnut, some scrap pine and a 1/4-20 to 5/8-27 adapter made out of Jatoba. I may cover making the adapters in another post some day.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyle-Pro-PDMIC78-Professional-Handheld-Microphone/dp/B005BSOVRY">Pyle PDMIC78</a> on there which I purchased for under $10. Surprisingly it works just fine. I figured Iâ€™d give it a shot on toms and so far I think I can recommend it for that task.</p>

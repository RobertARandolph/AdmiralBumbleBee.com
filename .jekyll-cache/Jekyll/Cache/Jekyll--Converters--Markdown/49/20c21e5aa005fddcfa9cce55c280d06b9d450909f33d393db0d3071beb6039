<p>I’m taking a short break (~5-7 days) for this holiday season. I’m not counting these next few days as part of my <a href="/music/2017/12/14/30-days-of-Apple-Logic-Pro-X.html">30 days with Logic Pro X</a> so don’t worry, you’re not getting ripped off!</p>

<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, check out some of the gifts I received for Christmas!</p>

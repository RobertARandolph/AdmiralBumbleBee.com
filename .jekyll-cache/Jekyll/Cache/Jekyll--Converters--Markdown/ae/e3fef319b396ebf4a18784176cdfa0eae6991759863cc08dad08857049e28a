<p>A while ago I <a href="/music/2016/12/16/Things-I-hate-about-Digital-Performer.html">wrote a bit of an article about what I hated in Digital Performer</a>. (I have updated that post as well!)</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://motu.com/newsitems/digital-performer-10-is-now-shipping">Digital Performer 10 is out!</a>.</p>

<p>I had a bunch of prepared content for DP10, but it appears that other press, including MOTU, managed to cover the same topics I was going to. I <em>hate</em> duplicating content and I avoid it if possible. I sorted those posts away. <strong>THIS IS NOT A THOROUGH REVIEW</strong>. It’s just the things I like about the update.</p>

<p>Let me walk you through what I like about DP 10, and why I’m back to using DP10 as my main driver. (<a href="/music/2018/08/29/Cubase-and-Me.html">I switched to Cubase in Aug 28, 2018</a> while waiting for DP10 if you don’t remember.)</p>

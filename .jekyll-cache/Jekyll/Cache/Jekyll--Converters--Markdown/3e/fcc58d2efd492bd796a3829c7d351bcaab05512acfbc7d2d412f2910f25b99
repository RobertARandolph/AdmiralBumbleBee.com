<p>Mixbus is often seen as a program that, after doing all of your work in another DAW, you drop in stems and mix with. I don’t think that this is necessarily the best use of Mixbus, since it’s a fantastic full-fledged DAW in its own right, however it is one of the best aspects of Mixbus.</p>

<p>The mixer in mixbus is not your typical digital summing box.  Each channel has a selection of features that optionally can be sent to a mixbus with a number of features that goes to a master bus with a number of features which can optionally go through a monitoring section with a number of features.</p>

<p>Let’s just dive in and go through what the Mixbus 32c mixer offers.</p>

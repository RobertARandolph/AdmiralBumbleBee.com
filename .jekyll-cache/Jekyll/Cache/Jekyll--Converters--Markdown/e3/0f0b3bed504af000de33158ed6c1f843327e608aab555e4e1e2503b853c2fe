<p>Some DAWs have macro controls that let you control many parameters with 1 control. Reaper has this capability, but with a lot more flexibility.</p>

<p>In the following tutorial Iâ€™m going to show you how to control almost <em>any</em> parameter in your project with a single slider. Not only that, but you can setup a <em>fader</em> to control all those parameters too!</p>

<p>Click through for the full tutorialâ€¦</p>

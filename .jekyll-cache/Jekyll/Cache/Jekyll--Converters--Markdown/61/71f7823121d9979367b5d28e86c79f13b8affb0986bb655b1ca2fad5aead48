I"y<p>Iâ€™ve added a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> site search to this website.</p>

<p>If you see the search box in a seemingly weird place, then you need to clear your browser cache. Usually holding control (Win) or command (mac) then pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Refresh</code> (usually F5) will do that.</p>

<p>Please read about <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">why I used DuckDuckgo</a>. They also do not host ads for competing websites in my search results by default, where as google has no way to turn off ads in search results. I hate ads. Eww.</p>

<p>Thanks as always for reading!</p>

<p>A while ago I <a href="/music/2016/12/16/Things-I-hate-about-Digital-Performer.html">wrote a bit of an article about what I hated in Digital Performer</a>. (I have updated that post as well!)</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://motu.com/newsitems/digital-performer-10-is-now-shipping">Digital Performer 10 is out!</a>.</p>

<p>I had a bunch of prepared content for DP10, but it appears that other press, including MOTU, managed to cover the same topics I was going to. I <em>hate</em> duplicating content and I avoid it if possible. I sorted those posts away. <strong>THIS IS NOT A THOROUGH REVIEW</strong>. It‚Äôs just the things I like about the update.</p>

<p>Let me walk you through what I like about DP 10, and why I‚Äôm back to using DP10 as my main driver. (<a href="/music/2018/08/29/Cubase-and-Me.html">I switched to Cubase in Aug 28, 2018</a> while waiting for DP10 if you don‚Äôt remember.)</p>

<h2 id="nearly-100-bug-fixes">Nearly 100 bug fixes</h2>

<p>This isn‚Äôt the sort of thing that MOTU advertises very well, but by my account there‚Äôs nearly 100 bug fixes over DP9.5.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the Windows version is finally usable I think. Version 8 was awful. 9 was hit or miss. Version 10 has been excellent, minus some GUI weirdness on occasion.</p>

<h2 id="spotlight---sorta">Spotlight - sorta</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre not a macOS user, then may not know the beauty of spotlight (or <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred!</a>, which is what I use). Windows search is terrible in comparison.</p>

<p>The idea is that you press a key combo and then have a ‚Äòglobal search‚Äô of sorts. DP10 has that now.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Shift-Space</code> and now you can quickly find any command you need. No more assigning arcane shortcuts that you‚Äôll never remember, or searching the menus for 30 seconds to find that <em>one quick thing</em>.</p>

<p>DP has solved this better than any other DAW by just ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù a perfectly working concept from their original platform.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs brilliant.</p>

<p>If you <a href="/music/2018/10/13/Reapers-amazing-menu-system.html">watched my video about radial menus</a> then you may be surprised that I prefer DP10‚Äôs system over radial menus.</p>

<p>The concept is similar, but instead of mentally mapping <em>location</em> to a command, you can just utilize the spelling of the command itself. Even if you <em>forget</em> where it is, you can remember it. Eventually you‚Äôll learn some quick nonsensical shortcuts like <code class="highlighter-rouge">mo i</code> to find ‚ÄòMove Insertion Point Left‚Äô.</p>

<p>The downside is that it doesn‚Äôt have smart fuzzy searching. If you wanted to search for ‚ÄúQuantize Note‚Äù, you can‚Äôt type <code class="highlighter-rouge">QN</code>. I wish Motu would improve that.</p>

<p><a href="/music/2019/03/01/dp-10-vca.html">I already explained VCAs in DP10</a>.</p>

<p>I love this feature, and it‚Äôs the <a href="#conclusion">#1 reason I‚Äôm not going to spoil the conclusion</a></p>

<h2 id="absolute-snapping">Absolute Snapping</h2>

</video>
<div class="video-caption">Absolute and Relative Snapping</div>

<p>This is one of my favorite features.</p>

<p>Previously Digital Performer would only allow you to move a note or a soundbite (region/clip/item) <strong>by</strong> the amount set in the group. If you wanted to move a note to a grid line then were are forced to use the quantize menu, which is not the best of workflows.</p>

<p>In Digital Performer 10, you can now turn off relative snapping so that things that you want to move will move to the grid lines instead of moving by the grid amount.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs optional, so if you like the ‚Äòrelative‚Äô behaviour you can toggle it on/off at will.</p>

</video>
<div class="video-caption">Auto Snapping Divisions</div>

<p>Fixed snapping is when you setup the snapping divisions yourself.</p>

<p>Auto is when you allow DP to decide what the most reasonable snapping division is based on the current view width. No more zooming in to find out that your snapping division is larger than the view!</p>

<source src="/assets/DP/10/Stretch.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<div class="video-caption">Warping, stretching, WOO!</div>

<p>Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves. This is not a revolutionary feature. Other DAWs have had it for a long while, but I think DP does it better‚Ä¶ in the main way it matters.</p>

<p>Firstly, <a href="/music/2019/01/06/ZTX-vs-Elastique50.html">ZTX stretching is used instead of Elastique</a>, and I personally prefer ZTX. You can hit that link and choose for yourself! Getting a good sounding result is the #1 thing, and I think that DP nails it.</p>

<p>There are some issues though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can‚Äôt drop your own markers when in the Sequence Editor (the main view), or I can‚Äôt figure it out. Adding beat markers requires going to the Waveform Editor, switching to ‚ÄúBeats‚Äù mode and using the pencil tool. It‚Äôs a bit cumbersome, but it does force you to work in a more precise manner than I think many of use would. It‚Äôs still bothersome regardless.</li>
  <li>There are limits on how far you can move things. If you like using stretch to make crazy sound effects, then you‚Äôre out of luck. For the sane user, this is a nice protection. For the crazy folks (like me!), it‚Äôs less fun.</li>
  <li>No multitrack stretching in this manner. You must utilize quantization for multitrack stretching (like on multitracked drums). Currently you can not manually do this.
    <ul>
      <li>I <em>STILL</em> have to dump my tracks out of DP10 most of the time, because I multitrack nearly everything. I rarely record something with just one microphone, and that means that I have to use Pro Tools or Studio One or Reaper instead.
        <ul>
          <li>There is a workaround. It‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVXFw9yRFOo">the same as this ancient Cubase workaround</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vst3-support">VST3 Support</h2>

    <img src="/assets/DP/10/Primary.png" alt="VST3 Support">
<div class="image-caption">VST3</div>

<p>I‚Äôd love to have a big section about this, but I haven‚Äôt tested if/what <a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html">VST3 features</a> are supported.</p>

<p>All of my VST3 plugins work though, and that‚Äôs <strong>A LOT</strong> of them.</p>

<h2 id="quantize-and-move">Quantize and move</h2>

<img src="/assets/DP/10/Quantize.png" alt="Quantize and Move">
<div class="image-caption">Quantize and Move</div>

<p>Quantizing soundbites (clips/items/regions) and MIDI data can now optionally move associated data (automation or CC, respectively) with it.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt do this naively for MIDI either. Things are stretched between quantization paths, so you end up with something fairly natural instead of just some clump of data moved.</p>

<p>Groove Quantize has this too now.</p>

<p>Excellent feature addition and exceptionally helpful.</p>

<h2 id="midi-note-velocity-display">MIDI Note Velocity Display</h2>

<img src="/assets/DP/10/Velocity.png" alt="Velocity is easier to see now!">
<div class="image-caption">Velocity is easier to see now!</div>

<p>There‚Äôs now an option to display velocity as a bar inside notes. A great feature to have when programming MIDI or working with MIDI in general.</p>

<p>Actually <em>changing</em> MIDI velocity in DP is still <strong>terrible</strong>, but this is a big step in the correct direction.</p>

<h3 id="new-midi-velocity">New MIDI Velocity</h3>

<img src="/assets/DP/10/Marks.png" alt="Velocity Marks">
<div class="image-caption">Velocity Marks</div>

<p>Let‚Äôs play a game! It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúSpot the Velocity marks‚Äù.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve already lost the game.</p>

<p>Even though you can now clearly <em>see</em> velocity as colour, or as a bar in the note, the actual editing space is still terrible to work in. <a href="http://www.motunation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=51416">There are ways to make them <em>slightly</em> more visible</a>. That doesn‚Äôt help much.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> I have a video on a ‚Äòworkaround‚Äô, that I think actually makes editing MIDI Velocity in DP a pleasant experience. It can be difficult to see what you‚Äôre doing, but actually doing it is a breeze!</p>

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JSWRVc0KBUE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="adjustable-cue-transport">Adjustable Cue Transport</h2>

<img src="/assets/DP/10/CueT.png" alt="Transport Cueing">
<div class="image-caption">Transport Cueing</div>

<p>Those little rewind/forward buttons are finally useful! You can configure how far they move, and what measurement they increment in.</p>

<p>This is a feature missing from quite a few products. It‚Äôs irritating to zoom in and edit, only to find that you need to mess with a scrollbar to approximate a new location. It just makes temporal navigation in the project much easier.</p>

<h2 id="region-presets">Region presets</h2>

<img src="/assets/DP/10/RPresets.png" alt="Region Presets">
<div class="image-caption">Region Presets</div>

<p><strong>AWESOME</strong>.</p>

<p>You can save presets for just about any MIDI transformation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transpose</li>
  <li>Quantize</li>
  <li>Humanize</li>
  <li>De-Flam</li>
  <li>Change Velocity (MIDI Compression)</li>
  <li>Change Duration</li>
  <li>Split Notes (very useful for drum patterns!)</li>
  <li>Invert pitch</li>
  <li>Insert Continuous Data (very useful for drums again!)</li>
  <li>Thin Continuous Data</li>
  <li>Change Continuous Data</li>
  <li>Re-assign Continuous Data</li>
  <li>Insert Loop</li>
  <li>Echo</li>
  <li>Arpeggiator (drum patterns!)</li>
  <li>Transpose (plug-in version)</li>
  <li>Re-assign Continuous Data (plug-in version)</li>
  <li>Remove Duplicates</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these can have their settings saved and recalled quickly and easily.</p>

<p>The kicker is that you can easily assign a shortcut to a preset. Now any sort of common transformation (or data creation!) can quickly be recalled.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>HUGE</strong> feature.</p>

<h1 id="minor-things">Minor things</h1>

<h2 id="gui-scaling">GUI Scaling</h2>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">

</video>
<div class="video-caption">GUI Scaling</div>

<p>I‚Äôve listed this as a ‚Äúminor thing‚Äù, because I personally think it‚Äôs not useful for your average person. When you zoom the GUI to be larger, then you have lost screen real estate. It doesn‚Äôt in <em>any way</em> fix the issue of DP having small GUI elements. It makes <em>everything</em> bigger when you may only want <em>some</em> things to be bigger.</p>

<p>That said, I can see it being particularly useful on very large displays. I already use it that way.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs still a great feature to have.</p>

<h2 id="info-box">Info Box</h2>

<video autoplay loop muted class="gifvid">
<source src="/assets/DP/10/InfoBox.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<div class="video-caption">Info Box</div>

<p>There‚Äôs a nice new info box when dragging a soundbite!</p>

<p>It also follows your time ruler‚Äôs measurement format. If you work in frames, then it shows frames. Samples, Time and Bars/Beats as well.</p>

<h2 id="alternate-tool">Alternate Tool</h2>

<p>Some DAW users will roll their eyes at this thinking ‚ÄúWe had this for DECADES!‚Äù</p>

<p>DP users get it now. Rejoice. It‚Äôs a workflow boon.</p>

<h2 id="sounds">Sounds!</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs 5.5gb of loops and sounds and stuff.</p>

<p>I really don‚Äôt care about them, but if you do then I‚Äôm certainly not the person to give you an informed opinion about them.</p>

<p>The Event List now has filters for quick viewing of data.</p>

<p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> event lists. Editing in the event list is the way to go for precision and persnickety tasks.</p>

<div class="video-caption">Playhead Snapping</div>

<p>Nothing was more annoying in older versions of DP than working with time delineated things (loops, memory markers (timeline loops), quantized MIDI, etc‚Ä¶) and trying to get the playhead to the correct place: right on the beat.</p>

<p>Now it snaps to your current snap preference for any measurement size or division. Much better workflow!</p>

<h1 id="ewwww-what-were-you-thinking">EWWWW, what were you thinking?</h1>

<h2 id="clips-window">Clips Window</h2>

<img src="/assets/DP/10/Clips.png" alt="Clips Window">
<div class="image-caption">Clips Window</div>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about all the things that you <strong>can‚Äôt do</strong> in the clips window!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Horizontally resize tracks.</li>
  <li>Sequentially name scenes.</li>
  <li>Easily rename your clips (you have to click at least twice, half way across the screen, to rename something).</li>
  <li>Rename your tracks?.</li>
  <li>Drag in clips quickly. There‚Äôs a pause after every clip or so. I have an ultra-fast system and even I have to wait 5+ seconds to drag a clip in sometimes!</li>
  <li>Turn on stretching for a track!!!!!
    <ul>
      <li>In order for things to play in tempo, if you‚Äôre utilizing clips of varying tempos, you need to turn on stretching. This is <em>vital</em> to the operation of the Clips window, and you need to switch to another window to do that <em>for each track</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select a track.</li>
  <li>Re-arrange scenes.</li>
  <li>Contiguously select files.</li>
  <li>Utilize folder tracks in any way.</li>
  <li>Know if your clip is playing by looking at it.</li>
  <li>Have varying tempo and time signature per scene.</li>
  <li>Mix stereo/audio files
    <ul>
      <li>You will invariably want to put a stereo clip on a ‚Äúmono track‚Äù or vice versa and be utterly confused why you can‚Äôt play the track. DP will <em>even animate queueing the clip</em>, but not play it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the Clips Window without playback.
    <ul>
      <li>If you have any audio in your project at all, it will play back <em>any time you use the Clips Window</em>. So you can‚Äôt use the clips window for trying out ideas easily.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Record audio.</li>
  <li>Record MIDI.</li>
  <li>Record your Clips Window sequences. This is currently a <em>huge</em> missing feature.</li>
  <li>Sequence clip playback.
    <ul>
      <li>There‚Äôs no <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/launching-clips/">clip follow actions</a> like Live for instance. You can only queue clips in DP.
*</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>USE THE DARN THING!!!!!!!
    <ul>
      <li>I would say that probably 50% of the time, the clips don‚Äôt even make sound for me. DP will show the playback. It will play back another identical clip in the same project, on the same track or even moved to the same scene. Ugh. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because of sample rate mismatches and stuck analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you drag in a clip, it‚Äôs not automatically selected in the editor below.</p>

<p>What does the Clips Window do well?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The audio/MIDI editing options are excellent, since you get the normal DP editing capabilities at the bottom rather than some unfamiliar/butchered. Much nicer than <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/en/home.html">Bitwig</a> or <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton Live</a>.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs a grid.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clips window is only mildly exciting if you are running live shows and need a soundboard. If you have ever used FLStudio, Live or Bitwig then you will be <em>*severely disappointed</em>.</p>

<h2 id="content-browser">Content Browser</h2>

<img src="/assets/DP/10/ContentBrowser.png" alt="Content Browser">
<div class="image-caption">Content Browser</div>

<p>Digital Performer has rightfully had a vocal contingent that disliked the absence of an integrated browser.</p>

<p>Now they have something even worse than the OS‚Äôs integrated browser! Hooray!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about what you can‚Äôt do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Control the transport.</li>
  <li>View waveforms/MIDI.
    <ul>
      <li>Nor can you select anything.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See plugin information.</li>
  <li>Tag.</li>
  <li>Search.</li>
  <li>Preview instruments/effects.</li>
  <li>USE effects or instruments.
    <ul>
      <li>They can‚Äôt be dragged or inserted unless there‚Äôs a preset, which there isn‚Äôt for VST2/3 for me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Process selections, since you can‚Äôt select anything other than ‚Äòthe file/effect/instrument‚Äô.
    <ul>
      <li>Can‚Äôt process files either.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What CAN you do?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Save ‚Äòplaces‚Äô (directories)</li>
  <li>Save and recall Clippings, which is DP‚Äôs way of saving almost anything (including tracks/sequences).</li>
  <li>Browse directories you‚Äôve painstakingly added, manually.</li>
  <li>Browse effects and their presets (no presets show for VST2).</li>
  <li>Browse Instruments and their presets (once again, VST2 doesn‚Äôt show anything)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot, the information at the bottom is cluttered and difficult to read (white on grey?).</p>

<p>Window‚Äôs Explorer and macOS‚Äôs Finder are vastly superior to the Content Browser in DP10 other than the CB‚Äôs ability to dock it in the main window.</p>

<p>I understand that maybe there was pressure to add a feature like this, but it‚Äôs half-cocked and quite a poor show. I don‚Äôt understand how people at MOTU weren‚Äôt embarrassed to put this out! Even the DAWs that people make fun of as ‚Äútoys‚Äù or ‚Äúhobbyist‚Äù products have significantly better browsers! <strong>Even the text editor I‚Äôm writing this in has a <em>vastly</em> superior browser!</strong> Maybe they thought that they needed something to go along with the <a href="#clips-window">Clips Window</a>, but that‚Äôs not the greatest reason, obviously.</p>

<p>Every single DAW on my system has a better browser. EVERY single one. If I had <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org">Audacity</a> installed then at least DP would win over that, because Audacity doesn‚Äôt have a browser. Wait, I take it back, no browser is an improvement.</p>

<p>I know MOTU knows what I think about this already, but c‚Äômon guys. What a shame.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Most of these things are not a big deal to users of other DAWs. DP10 has largely been a quality of life improvement for existing users. How many people can say that about their DAW‚Äôs updates? ‚ÄúYay, they made my life better instead of adding random stuff I don‚Äôt care about!‚Äù</p>

<p>Not many people can say that. (Image Line does great at this though!)</p>

<p>The <a href="#content-browser">content browser</a> is in an unfortunate state currently. <a href="#clips-window">The Clip Window</a> is not what it appears to be, or much of anything really. Let‚Äôs just assume these features don‚Äôt exist at all.</p>

<p>When you take what <em>was</em> added, it‚Äôs still a really great update. Yes, it‚Äôs mostly features that other DAWs have, but now DP has them. Do other DAWs have <a href="/music/2016/12/12/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-3.html#chunks">chunks</a>? A <strong>huge</strong> variety of MIDI tools? <a href="/music/2016/12/10/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-1.html#tracks-overview-window">An easy way to work in a huge project</a> and the <a href="/music/2016/12/13/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-4.html#track-selector-and-track-layouts">tools to navigate those projects</a>? <a href="/music/2016/12/13/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-4.html#search-window">Project-wide logic-based search</a> <em>Five</em> types of MIDI editors (two of which are notation), one of the best stock plugin selections, <a href="/music/2019/01/06/ZTX-vs-Elastique78.html">ZTX</a>, a proper meter bridge, <a href="/music/2016/12/10/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-1.html#polar">POLAR</a>, <a href="/music/2016/12/14/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-5.html#clippings">clippings</a>, <a href="/music/2016/12/11/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-2.html#branching-undo">offline branching undo</a>, <a href="/music/2016/12/11/Cool-Features-in-Digital-Performer/.-Part-2.html#track-grouping">fine-grained track grouping</a>, <a href="/music/2019/03/10/Daw-V-Daw-Automation.html">possibly the best sounding automation</a>, OMF/AAF support, Support that might <em>actually</em> respond to you, video support and‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Yeah. Every DAW has a selection of those features. DP has them all.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not to say that DP isn‚Äôt without some faults, but it certainly has had a leg up on other products for a <em>long</em> time in many areas.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to see this update as DP playing catchup, but I‚Äôve always felt DP was a jalopy that somehow was <em>just behind</em> the head of the pack. They‚Äôve fixed it up that beat up old clunker and in the last 3 versions it‚Äôs starting to break to the front.</p>

<p>Hopefully in 10.5 we see some major updates to two certain features though :)</p>

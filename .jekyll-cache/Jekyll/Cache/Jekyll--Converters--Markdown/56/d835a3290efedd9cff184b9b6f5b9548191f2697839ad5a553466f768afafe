<p>My 1 month (total) venture with Studio One 3 has come to a close. I didn’t write about some basics such as audio editing and midi editing, but I certainly did experience them.</p>

<p>Studio One 3 is not my preference. There’s a variety of reasons, but for me it comes down to 2 main things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drag and Drop paradigm is way too heavily enforced.</li>
  <li>Lack of features geared towards refining things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me explain why these are an issue for me, and relay my overall experience (the poison).</p>

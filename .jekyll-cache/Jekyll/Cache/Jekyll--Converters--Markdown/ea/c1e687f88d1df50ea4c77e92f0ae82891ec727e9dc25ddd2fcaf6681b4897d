<strong>Beautiful and functional apron</strong></p>

<p>So here’s my awesome new apron that my wife made for me. It’s a cross-backed apron with locking clips at the waist for holding it <em>snuggly</em> against my body. Custom fit, and it feels <strong>so nice</strong> to wear even with a bunch of stuff hanging off it.</p>

<p>I can bend, twist, squat, sit and spin in circles without the slightest bit of discomfort despite having a number of commonly used tools on me.</p>

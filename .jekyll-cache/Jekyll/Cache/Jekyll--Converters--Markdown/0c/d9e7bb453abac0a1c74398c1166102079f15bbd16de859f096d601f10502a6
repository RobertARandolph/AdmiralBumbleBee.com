<p>Part 2 of <a href="/music/2018/02/28/30-days-with-Tracktion-Waveform-9.html">30 days with Tracktion Waveform 9</a>. Iâ€™m trying to get these out every 3-4 days, but I was unable to last week so we ended up having that <a href="/music/2018/03/11/Interview-with-Ben-Loftis-of-Harrison-Consoles-about-Mixbus.html">interview with Ben Loftis of Harrison and Mixbus</a>.</p>

<p>Today Iâ€™m going to cover some <em>really</em> cool things, some annoyances that seem minor (but really irk me!), and the weird core of Waveformâ€™s design philosophy.</p>

<p>Waveform 9 introduced Modifiers. These are modulators, which means that they generate a signal that attaches to an automatable parameter and automatically automates it.</p>

<p>Waveform has 6 modifiers currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LFO - LFO generates a waveform with variable offset, phase and depth. The LFO can run â€˜freeâ€™, meaning that itâ€™s not synced to the project, or it can be locked to project transport <em>or</em> note-on. The signal can be unipolar (always &gt; 0) or bipolar (-1 to +1).</li>
  <li>Breakpoint - 1-4 points that can be moved. Selectable as unipolar/bipolar, freerunning/transport/note sync.</li>
  <li>Step - A 2-64 step sequencer. Each step is assigned a value and itâ€™s played back at the selected speed.</li>
  <li>Envelope Follower - Maps incoming audio to a modulation signal. The signal can be low or high passed, with adjustable depth and offset. Thereâ€™s a gain adjustment and adjustments for the attack/hold/release of the follower (this controls how aggressively it follows those portions of the input signal.)</li>
  <li>Random - A randomized signal. Variable between square/triangle shapes with optional smoothing. Depth and polarity are controllable as well.</li>
  <li>Midi Tracker - Midi tracker takes incoming MIDI note data and maps it to a modulation signal based on the mapping graph. Velocity and pitch are selectable and these are variable between absolute and relative modes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding a modifier isnâ€™t too difficult. Drag the orange knob in the upper right to a â€˜filterâ€™ (or plugin as most of us call it). Select the parameter and setup your modifier.</p>

<p>Modifiers output is assigned to other parameters by clicking the -&gt;O (knob) button, then you can drag the knob in the right hand column of the parameter you wish to modulate. The amount of modulation is shown by a light grey outline that indicates if itâ€™s modulating by a positive or negative influence. All plugins on the track are selectable, <em>including other modifiers</em>. (Some of these routings, like envelope follower to its own release, will cause Waveform to crash! Oops! <strong>EDIT</strong> - This is fixed in Waveform 9.0.38 beta or higher)</p>

<p>A nice feature of modulators is that you donâ€™t have to select between beats and non-beats modes. Itâ€™s always beats multiplied by some factor. So you end up with a full range of motion thatâ€™s still relative to a musical value.</p>

<p>Modifiers work with plugins. Any automatable parameter can be modulated by a modifier.</p>

<p>Modifiers work with <a href="/music/2018/03/18/Waveform-9-the-good-the-bad-the-weird-part-3.html#macro-parameters">macro parameters as well</a></p>

<p>The modifier system is fun. Itâ€™s useful. Itâ€™d be a lot better if the envelope follower more easily took audio from other tracks.</p>

<h2 id="plugin-selector">Plugin Selector</h2>

<img src="/assets/Waveform/Good/PluginSelector.png" alt="plugin selector">
<div class="image-caption">plugin Selector</div>

<p>Somewhat hidden is Waveformâ€™s plugin selector window. Right click the <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> inside the arrow box in the upper right and youâ€™ll get a full screen plugin selector.</p>

<p>Plugins are shown with their native GUI if you <a href="#plugin-thumbnails">created thumbnails for them</a>. You can search in the search box to narrow down the list. It appears that plugin tags are not searched unfortunately, which is a big miss. Itâ€™d be nice to search for your â€˜compressorâ€™ tagged plugins to only show those.</p>

<p>To add a plugin you click and drag. The selector GUI disappears and you drag the plugin where you want it.</p>

<p>The plugin selector is an inspiring way to browse your plugins.</p>

<h2 id="plugin-thumbnails">Plugin Thumbnails</h2>

<img src="/assets/Waveform/Good/Thumbnails.png" alt="Scan plugin thumbnails">
<div class="image-caption">Scanning for plugin thumbnails</div>

<p>To use the <a href="#plugin-selector">plugin Selector</a> in its optimal state you need to have images of every plugin. What a drag! Or is it?</p>

<p>In the Settings tab under Plugins you can <code class="highlighter-rouge">Scan for plugin thumbnails</code>. This is a totally automatic process that opens each plugin and screencaptures a thumbnail of it.</p>

<p>This process can take a while the first time you did it. I have <strong>A LOT</strong> of plugins and it took me nearly 80 minutes the first time. Luckily Waveform allows you to only scan new plugins or scan selected plugins. When a plugin is opened, thereâ€™s a camera icon in the upper right of the window title bar. So you can change the pluginâ€™s GUI and take a new screenshot without much hassle if the automatic screenshot is subpar.</p>

<p>Other DAWs have a similar feature, but itâ€™s usually manual and doesnâ€™t integrate as nicely as this does with the <a href="#plugin-selectoR">plugin selector</a></p>

<p>It seems like a small thing, but these plugin thumbnails do a great job of jogging your memory when youâ€™re trying to solve an issue and youâ€™re not 100% sure of what product will do what you need.</p>

<h1 id="the-bad">The bad</h1>

<h2 id="renaming-tracks-and-importing">Renaming Tracks and importing</h2>

<p>Renaming tracks is a bit of a pain. The default â€˜bestâ€™ workflow is to hit tab, type the track name, alt/option-down, tab, type track name, etcâ€¦</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a lot of hand moving around the keyboard when you have to rename 200 tracks (which I frequently do). The renaming method I outlined above only works if you have the bottom panel open too, so you may have to change your workflow depending on how you have Waveform setup. <strong>Waveform doesnâ€™t name new tracks with the imported file</strong> when you import a new file. So anything that you import to a new track requires renaming.</p>

<p>Other DAWs allow you to simply press tab for the next rename, or just the down arrow, or they have a special renaming functionality.</p>

<p>I know this is a minor nitpick to a lot of people, but to me itâ€™s a guaranteed hand cramp a couple times a week.</p>

<h2 id="track-colouring">Track colouring</h2>

<img src="/assets/Waveform/Bad/TrackColours.png" alt="Track Colour disappointment">
<div class="image-caption">Track Colours... that's it</div>

<p>Iâ€™m big on track colours. I think that it makes it much easier to visually locate items in large projects. I like to have a selection of bright coluors, muted colours and the capability to easily create colour gradients across tracks.</p>

<p>Waveform doesnâ€™t really do this very well.</p>

<p>That image above is the colours you get to select. A handful of muted, low-contrast colours. You can select gradients for a selection of tracks either. Not only that, but thereâ€™s no way to set colours for a folder so any time that you add something to a submix or a folder you have to manually colours it.</p>

<p>The colour system really needs an overhaul.</p>

<h2 id="modifier-nitpicks">Modifier Nitpicks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The rate knob doesnâ€™t respond to any sort of â€˜reset to defaultâ€™ message! Annoying.</li>
  <li>The Envelope Follower - This would <em>ideally</em> be the ultimate modifier. Anything you could make as an audio signal could be used as a modulator, but thereâ€™s <strong>a big issue</strong>. Envelope follower canâ€™t specifically take in audio from another track at a specific point. It uses audio thatâ€™s currently fed to it at the end of the track. If you want to have audio from one track modulate a parameter on another track from a specific point, <a href="/music/2018/03/15/Routing-Audio-to-Envelope-Follower-with-Racks-in-Waveform.html">it requires a cumbersome work around</a> with using a <a href="/music/2018/03/08/Waveform-9-the-good-the-bad-the-weird-part-1.html#racks">rack</a>. The envelope follower needs to be able to take in audio from other tracks, OR control parameters on other tracks <em>easily</em>. That would make this entire system better.</li>
  <li>Midi Tracker also canâ€™t select input. More cumbersome workarounds to make sure that the correct MIDI is getting to the modifier :(</li>
  <li>It is a bit strange that you canâ€™t simply drop a modifier on to a track without selecting a parameter, since this is possible to do when you move a modifier to a new track. Strange. (Actually, while writing this I discovered that sometimes you canâ€¦ if thereâ€™s been a modifier there recently. This is just inconsistent)</li>
  <li>Parameter search needs improvement - Searching for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Band Gain</code> on TEqualiser offers zero results even though thereâ€™s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Band 1 Gain</code> through <code class="highlighter-rouge">Band 2 Gain</code>. A â€˜fuzzy search`, even if it just substituted spaces for wild cards, would be nice.</li>
  <li><del>Modifiers modulating themselves is a quick way to get a crash . Goodbye Waveform. Poof. Gone. This is a useful functionality sometimes, but go ahead and save your project then have a modifier modulate its own rate. Waveform will do its best approximation of a Navy Landing. Iâ€™ve crashed Waveform probably a few 100 times while writing thisâ€¦ my curiousity got the best of me I think.</del> <strong>EDIT</strong> - This is fixed in Waveform 9.0.38 beta. A fix for this was posted 7 days after this blog post went up.</li>
  <li>Meta modifiers - There needs to be a way to scale, split, add, subtract, etcâ€¦ modifier signals. <a href="/music/2017/06/23/Bitwig-Modulators.html#math">Look at Bitwigâ€™s Math modulator</a>. Itâ€™s just a modulator that you modulate a parameter of it by other modulators. It then outputs the mathematical result of those 2 inputs. See the whole <a href="/music/2017/06/23/Bitwig-Modulators.html">Bitwig Modulators Page</a> for more examples.</li>
  <li>The Y axis of most modulators is unlabeled. Want to know what value or relative % your step is at? Too bad. Want to know what your breakpoint is doing? Tough luck.</li>
  <li>The random modifier has no determinate mode. There is no way to make sure that every playback is â€˜randomized the sameâ€™ so to say. This needs to be an option of the transport sync mode. It would be nice if the user could input or create their own random seed as well.</li>
  <li>MIDI Assignment - You can assign MIDI CC to Modifier controls, but how do you adjust or change that?! I have no clue. I searched and I could not figure out how to adjust or delete those assignments.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-weird">The Weird</h1>

<h2 id="single-pane-interface">Single Pane Interface</h2>

<img src="/assets/Waveform/TracktionIntro.png" alt="Tracktion">
<div class="image-caption">Tracktion Waveform in one screen</div>

<p>One of the main design aspects of Waveform is that basically everything is in one pane. Yes thereâ€™s a Projects tab. Thereâ€™s a settings Tab. The mixer can go in to its own tab. The MIDI editor can spawn a new window. Plugins have their own windows.</p>

<p>Wait a second. Thatâ€™s not everything in one window?!</p>

<p>It really confuses me when I use Waveform sometimes. Thereâ€™s a lot of things on screen sometimes. Itâ€™s actually nice for a good portion of your average workflow, but at times it is rather overwhelming. I donâ€™t need to see 26 (I counted) different widgets when I just want to change the colour of a MIDI item. That is a lot of clutter. I donâ€™t want to see 25 widgets when I want to add a new tag to a track. I also donâ€™t want to have to wait for a silly animation when I collapse that panel.</p>

<p>Adding plugins is always a click-and-drag affair, <a href="/music/2016/06/15/Studio-PoisOne.html#drag-and-drop">which I hate</a>. Thereâ€™s really no way around it because the interface is all smushed together to make space for <em>an entire DAW on one screen</em>.</p>

<p>Some of these things go back <a href="/music/2018/03/08/Waveform-9-the-good-the-bad-the-weird-part-1.html#non-native">to one of my earlier complaints as well</a>. Ctrl-tab doesnâ€™t switch between tabs. Cmd-` (mac) and alt-tab (win) doesnâ€™t cycle between the main pane and the midi editor. Tab doesnâ€™t switch between pane focus. Itâ€™s strange man, strange.</p>

<p>Of course I canâ€™t label this as a <em>bad</em> thing. Itâ€™s unique and I can certainly see how this is a great GUI paradigm for certain workflows. I feel like itâ€™s becoming clear that no amount of clever-thinking is going to allow the Waveform team to continue expanding the feature set of the product all on one screen. Iâ€™ve been following Tracktion since V1, and Version 8 was the first time I really started to feel like the single pane is just not enough space for the functionality confined in to it.</p>

<p>And yeahâ€¦ no other DAW really works exactly like this. Itâ€™s weird.</p>

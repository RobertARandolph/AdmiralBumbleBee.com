<p>I have nowhere in my studio to properly put headphones. It‚Äôs rather annoying.</p>

<p>So today I decided to make some simple hooks to screw on to my desk. I used a small port of a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-4-in-x-96-in-Yellow-Pine-Kiln-Dried-Stud-232971/202519496">pine 2x4</a>. The amount of wood used is about $0.56usd of wood.</p>

<p>The total cost of tools used was about $4,000usd. You could easily do this with a chisel, a $10 saw, a drill and some drill bits. Maybe I‚Äôll do something like that next time.</p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs get on to it!</p>

<h1 id="lumber">Lumber</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Lumber.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Lumber.jpg" alt="Starting Lumber">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Starting Lumber</div>

<p>This is the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-4-in-x-96-in-Yellow-Pine-Kiln-Dried-Stud-232971/202519496">piece of pine</a> that I‚Äôm starting with.</p>

<h1 id="mark-the-cutoff">Mark the cutoff</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Mark.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Mark.jpg" alt="Mark the cutoff">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Mark the cutoff</div>

<p>First thing that I need to do is mark the piece I‚Äôll be using. It‚Äôs 9‚Äù/23cm of wood. I use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_square">combination square</a> to mark it along with a pencil.</p>

<h1 id="cut-it-off">Cut it off</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Cutoff.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Cutoff.jpg" alt="Cut it off">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Cut off what we need</div>

<p>Here I‚Äôm using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_saw">Ryoba</a> to cut off the piece that I need. Specifically I‚Äôm using a <a href="https://www.woodcraft.com/products/razorsaw-ryoba-saw-240mm-no-610-with-replaceable-blade-gyokucho">Gyokucho 240mm no.610 Ryoba</a>.</p>

<p>A ryoba has 2 cutting sides. One for crosscuts (perpendicular to the grain) and one for rip cuts (parallel to the grain). I am using the crosscut side here since I‚Äôm cutting perpendicular to the grain.</p>

<h1 id="workpiece">Workpiece</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Piece.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Piece.jpg" alt="Workpiece">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Workpiece</div>

<p>The workpiece length was determined to be about 1‚Äù/2.5cm + the width of the wood + half the width of my largest headphones.</p>

<p>This comes out to about 8.5‚Äù/22cm</p>

<h1 id="split-the-workpiece">Split the workpiece</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Cutoff2.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Cutoff2.jpg" alt="Cut the workpiece">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Cut the workpiece</div>

<p>I need to create the part that gets screwed in, and the part that the dowel goes through.</p>

<p>I take a spare piece of wood and set it up as in the picture, remove the wood and mark it.</p>

<h1 id="cut-the-split">Cut the split</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Cut2.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Cut2.jpg" alt="Cut again">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Cut again!?</div>

<p>Now our workpiece is 2 workpieces!</p>

<h1 id="square-the-end-grain">Square the end grain</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/EndGrain.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/EndGrain.jpg" alt="Square the end grain">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Square up the end grain</div>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/Page.aspx?p=70926&amp;cat=1,230,41182,48945">the Veritas Shooting Plane</a> on a homemade shooting board to square the edges after the cut.</p>

<p>This hand plane has the blade at a 90¬∞ angle to the surface it sits on. You then make a board with a track that holds the plane. Then you can place the wood against a fence, at any angle you wish, and press the wood in to the plane blade to trim it.</p>

<p>This setup allows me to easily create edges that are perfect right angles to the adjacent faces.</p>

<h1 id="ohhh-shavings">Ohhh Shavings!</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Shaving.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Shaving.jpg" alt="Pretty Shaving">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">End grain shavings are cool</div>

<p>End grain shavings are super fun. It‚Äôs like dust. Blow on it and it falls apart.</p>

<p>You do need a <a href="/workshop/2017/03/17/Sharpening-Station.html">very sharp blade</a> to do that though.</p>

<h1 id="square-the-faces">Square the faces</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/SquareUp.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/SquareUp.jpg" alt="Square the other faces">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Square the other faces</div>

<p>After the end grain is squared, I then plane down the other edges. The pine that I am using has rounded edges, so I plane down till they are gone.</p>

<h1 id="shiny-faces">Shiny faces</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Shine.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Shine.jpg" alt="Shiny Shiny">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Shiny faces</div>

<p>With the proper blade angle, which I can change via blades selection <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=51870&amp;cat=1,41182,52515">in my Veritas BU Smoother</a>, the resulting surface of the wood is shiny.</p>

<p>MMMM. Shiny.</p>

<h1 id="center">Center</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Center1.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Center1.jpg" alt="Find the center">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Finding the center</div>

<p>I‚Äôm going to make most of this as one piece, then cut it in half. First I want to drill the holes for the dowels to go through.</p>

<p>To do this I need to visually split the workpiece in half. I draw an X from corner to corner, and where the lines cross is the center.</p>

<p>Then I set my combination square to that length and draw a line at each edge.</p>

<h1 id="center-of-the-center">Center of the center</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Center2.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Center2.jpg" alt="Center of the Center">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Center of the Center</div>

<p>Now I need to find the center of each half. I repeat the X procedure, but instead I work from corner of the wood to the center mark I made before.</p>

<h1 id="hole-mark">Hole Mark</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/HoleMark.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/HoleMark.jpg" alt="Holemark">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Hole Mark</div>

<p>Now I take that center point and mark a location for the dowel hole. The dowel hole is the same distance from both edges.</p>

<h1 id="hole-drill">Hole Drill</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/HoleDrill.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/HoleDrill.jpg" alt="Drilling the holes">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Drilling the holes</div>

<p>I drill the holes with a 3/4‚Äù/2cm <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=63566&amp;cat=1,180,42240,63566">Forstner bit</a>. These bits allow you to drill large holes with excellent results.</p>

<p>As you‚Äôll see though, pine isn‚Äôt the nicest of woods sometimes. I get some light tearout despite using a sacrificial backer in my drill press table.</p>

<h1 id="mortise-setup">Mortise setup</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/CutMark.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/CutMark.jpg" alt="Mortise setup">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Mortise Setup</div>

<p>I am going to cut a joint called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortise_and_tenon">mortise and tenon</a>.</p>

<p>To set this up I put my pieces in a T shape. I carefully center them by measuring each side until the measurements are the same. It takes about 30 second to do. The human eye is a pretty good judge of what‚Äôs centered most of the time.</p>

<p>I then use my <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=75849&amp;cat=1,42936">marking guage</a> to <em>cut</em> the marks. I do not mark this with a pencil. Cutting the mark pre-severs the grain and leaves a place to register my chisel later.</p>

<h1 id="marked-mortise">Marked mortise</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/MortiseMarked.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/MortiseMarked.jpg" alt="Marked Mortise">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Marked for mortising</div>

<p>This is the result of the marking gauge marks.</p>

<p>I did this somewhat poorly. You can see that the grain was crushed slightly instead of being cut. I should have used a marking knife instead. I underestimated how soft this wood is.</p>

<h1 id="pre-cut-the-mortise">Pre-cut the mortise</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/MortisePreCut.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/MortisePreCut.jpg" alt="Precut the mortise">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Pre-cut the mortise</div>

<p>I now use my ryoba to cut slightly inside the lines of the mortise. The edges will be trimmed later with a chisel. I just want to get the grain severed so that when I chisel it out next there won‚Äôt be any massive tearout.</p>

<h1 id="remove-the-waste">Remove the waste</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/MortiseChisel.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/MortiseChisel.jpg" alt="Remove the waste">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Remove the mortise waste</div>

<p>I now grab a <em>sharp</em> chisel and just hack out most of the waste. I stay away from the lines mostly and just bring it down to about 1/8‚Äù/3mm away from my lines.</p>

<h1 id="hand-route-the-remaining">Hand route the remaining</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Router.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Router.jpg" alt="hand route">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Hand routing the bottom</div>

<p>I use a <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=52609&amp;cat=1,41182,48945,52609">Veritas Router Plane</a> to carefully remove the remaining waste in the bottom of the mortise.</p>

<p>This tool is nothing more than a blade held parallel to the base, but it‚Äôs extended out. There is a screw mechanism that lets you adjust the depth of cut.</p>

<p>I remove about 1/32‚Äù/1mm of material at a time. There ends up being some blow out because pine just likes to randomly fall apart. I was careful to always cut ‚Äúin‚Äù to the wood, but the grain still just wants to go sometimes.</p>

<h1 id="trimming-the-mortise-edges">Trimming the mortise edges</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/MortiseClean.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/MortiseClean.jpg" alt="Trimming the mortise edges">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Mortise edge trimming</div>

<p>I now use a sharp chisel and a mallet to trim the edges of the mortise. <a href="#mortise-setup">Previously when I used a marking gauge to cut the lines</a>, that left me with nice lines in the wood where my chisel locks in nicely.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs simply a matter of putting your chisel in the cut and hammering it down straight. With a very sharp chisel this is easy work.</p>

<h1 id="mortise-test">Mortise test</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/MortiseTest.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/MortiseTest.jpg" alt="Mortise Test">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Testing the mortise</div>

<p>Fits perfect. Loose enough to put together with a pound of a fist, but you can‚Äôt shake it off.</p>

<p>Using the proper tools and methods makes this very simple. The mortise took me about 6 minutes to cut in total.</p>

<h1 id="a-look-inside-the-mortise-and-drilling-again">A look inside the mortise and drilling again</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/DirtyMortise.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/DirtyMortise.jpg" alt="Dirty mortise">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Not-so-clean mortise</div>

<p>Even though the fit is perfect, it‚Äôs not pretty inside!</p>

<p>I prefer this surface to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(woodworking)">router cut</a> mortise. I‚Äôve found that these bits of grain help hold a slightly sloppy mortise tight and allow for a much better glue joint.</p>

<p>When everything is pounded together, it looks great.</p>

<p>I also pre-drilled some holes in this piece. This is where the screws will go to screw the whole thing to the desk. I did an awful job. I needed to properly hone my <a href="http://www.rockler.com/skill-builders/putting-the-pieces-together/select-woodworking-countersink-drill-bits">countersink bit</a> before doing this. It still looks fine after everything is said and done.</p>

<h1 id="round-the-edges">Round the edges</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/RoundedMortise.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/RoundedMortise.jpg" alt="Round the holder">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Round the edges of the holder</div>

<p>Now I run the edges of the holder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(woodworking)">through a router</a> with a roundover bit. After the parts are glued, I won‚Äôt be able to reach this anymore because of the T-shape.</p>

<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/CutHolders.jpg" alt="Split the two parts">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Splitting the two parts</div>

<p>Now I split the 2 parts in half. This is done with the <em>rip side</em> of the ryoba.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs starting to look like I have 2 headphone holders now! (it‚Äôs also starting to look a bit phallic‚Ä¶)</p>

<div class="image-caption">Gluing the pieces</div>

<p>I now glue the 2 parts. Any glue is fine. Even white elmers glue is fine‚Ä¶ even cooked rice is fine. Just use plenty and get all of the surfaces sufficiently wet.</p>

<h1 id="dowels">Dowels</h1>

<a href="/assets/Headphones/Dowel.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Headphones/Thumbnails/Dowel.jpg" alt="Making Dowels">

<div class="image-caption">Making Dowels</div>

<p>I now need some 3/4‚Äù/2cm dowels. I just make this on my lathe while the glue is drying.</p>

<p>You could buy them at your hardware store. I have a lathe though and these only took me 5 minutes.</p>

<p>So now I go at it with <a href="https://www.highlandwoodworking.com/iwasaki-carving-files.aspx">my iwasaki files</a>. It only takes amount a minute to make convincing matching roundovers.</p>

<p>It would have been easier if I remembered to do this before!</p>

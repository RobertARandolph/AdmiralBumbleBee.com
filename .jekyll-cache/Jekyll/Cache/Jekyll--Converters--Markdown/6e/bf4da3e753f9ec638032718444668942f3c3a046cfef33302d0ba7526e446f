<p>I‚Äôm going to be upfront with you, I was (hint?) not a fan of Soothe since it has been released. Every time somebody asked me about it I was dismissive of it, and sometimes I was downright rude about it.</p>

<p>Despite this I have been constantly asked about my opinions about Soothe. A couple of times a week somebody would ask me, ‚ÄúIs Soothe worth it or is it just a gimmick?‚Äù</p>

<p>I have been asked this enough times that I finally contacted <a href="https://oeksound.com">oeksound</a> and I asked for an NFR review copy. Here we are now.</p>

<p>Is this thing just a gimmick?</p>

<p><strong>Time to get dirty.</strong></p>

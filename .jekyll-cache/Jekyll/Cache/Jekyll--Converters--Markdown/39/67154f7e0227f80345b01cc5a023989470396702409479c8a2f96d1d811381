<p>This is a bit of a meta-video that I suspect 95% of my readers wonâ€™t care about.</p>

<p>YouTube has a system of audio processing set up that is bewildering and annoying. I have figured out a system to process the audio of your videos so that they meet the YouTube audio standards about 95% of the time.</p>

<p>This method will cost you about five euros at most, and the single necessary plug-in is often on sale for half price or less.</p>

<p>I tested dozens of audio files from music to dialogue to various types of noise and various combinations of these. While my method will not always give you perfect results, it will get you close to the ideal results with minimal effort and minimal cost.</p>

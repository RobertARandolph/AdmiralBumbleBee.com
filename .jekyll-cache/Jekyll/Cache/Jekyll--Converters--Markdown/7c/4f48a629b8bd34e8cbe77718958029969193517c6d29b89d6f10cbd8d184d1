I"<p>I’m taking a bit of a break this half-week before I finish my <a href="http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus32c.html">Mixbus 32c</a> Review.</p>

<p>I have made some updates to the <a href="/ReaperScripts.html">Reaper Script Showcase</a> and the <a href="/DAW-Chart.html">DAW Feature Chart</a>. The DAW Feature chart has had a number of updates based on feedback from users. I’m not infallible! If you think I’ve made a mistak then please speak up.</p>

<p>I’ve also had some direct interaction with DAW Developers informing me of features that I may or may not know about, and some scores have been changed based on that feedback (betters <strong>and</strong> worse).</p>

<p>So meanwhile, check out those features and let me know what you think in the comments or via e-mail!</p>

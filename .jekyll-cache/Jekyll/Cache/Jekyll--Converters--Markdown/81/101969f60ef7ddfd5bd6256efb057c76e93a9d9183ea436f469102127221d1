<p>Itâ€™s not terribly uncommon for an old guitar to have an inner brace detach. Itâ€™s more likely if the guitar is thrown between high and low humidity and high to low temperature environments.</p>

<p>My wife has her motherâ€™s guitar which is a 70s Cortley. The guitar was heavily used and often left in a hot car. One of the braces on the top (on the opposite side of what you see) came loose.</p>

<p>It may not be totally obvious when this occurs, but a sudden or gradual deadening of the sustain is a sure-sign of an issue. You can also thumb the top with your finger around the guitar and take note of any drastic assymetrical differences along the axis continued by the fretboard. You can also just throw a mirror in side and check!</p>

<p>Let me show you how easy this is to fix, and how to do it right.</p>

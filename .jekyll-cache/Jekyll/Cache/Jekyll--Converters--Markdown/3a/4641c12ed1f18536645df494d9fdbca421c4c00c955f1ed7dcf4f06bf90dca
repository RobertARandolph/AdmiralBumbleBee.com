I"ÓI<p>No pictures today, just words.</p>

<p>Currently Iâ€™m still going back and forth about switching from DP 9 to Cubase 8.5. I really enjoy Cubase so far, however thereâ€™s a few things that have me reconsidering.</p>

<h1 id="digital-performer-the-good-stuff">Digital Performer: The Good Stuff</h1>

<h2 id="polar">Polar</h2>

<p>Google it, youtube it. Whatever. I love POLAR. Itâ€™s only available in DP.</p>

<h2 id="masterworks-collection">Masterworks Collection</h2>

<p><a href="http://motu.com/products/software/mwc">The Masterworks Collection</a> that is included in DP is actually really good. The LA-2A emulation is fantastic. I sold all my plugins that overlap with what the Masterworks Collection can do.</p>

<p>So if I switch to Cubase, Iâ€™m going to have to spend a lot of time and some extra money finding an 1176 and LA-2A emulation thatâ€™s as good as what comes with DP.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-eq-and-more">Dynamic EQ and more</h2>

<p>I love DPâ€™s Dynamic EQ. I have a few third-party dynamic EQ plugins and they just donâ€™t compare for me.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s also some really useful plugins like the Precision Delay, Subkick and Megasynth that are just very useful.</p>

<h2 id="looks">Looks</h2>

<p>I really like the Eight Bit theme that you can see on <a href="http://motu.com/products/software/dp/features.html">the features page under themes</a>.</p>

<p>I am not really much of a fan of dark UIs, which Cubase certainly is even after you hand-modify a bunch of colours yourself.</p>

<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>

<p>I love DPâ€™s transport. The memory functions are awesome and I much prefer them to how Cubaseâ€™s loop/cycle markers work. DPâ€™s transport is simply more flexible.</p>

<p>I also much prefer the methods of timeline selection, cycle selection and playback cursor control in DP. Itâ€™s much more flexible and allows you to adapts your workflow. Simple things such as having the cursor return to playback position or not are simple in DP. Not simple in Cubase.</p>

<h2 id="chunks">Chunks</h2>

<p>I canâ€™t hammer this home enough. Chunks <strong>are awesome</strong>. They let me rip out parts of a track and work on them in their own little project and recombine them easily in various ways. Likewise it makes it easy to move parts between songs, manage songs themselves, use for track templates and more.</p>

<p>The modularity of â€˜anything in a project can be a project or put in to a projectâ€™ is very useful. I really miss that in Cubase.</p>

<h2 id="tracks-overview">Tracks Overview</h2>

<p>The Tracks Overview window in DP is awesome. Itâ€™s a very quick and easy way to make â€˜macro-levelâ€™ changes to a project and easily manage huge projects.</p>

<p>Yes you can do this in other software <em>kinda</em> by just zooming out a lot (or using a zoom preset), but the convenience of the Tracks Overview is awesome. It also presents relevant information in a more coherent way considering that you are being presented with a large-scale view of the project. Zoom levels do not do that, they just squish everything!</p>

<h2 id="dps-channel-strip">DPâ€™s Channel strip</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m not talking about a channel strip plugin, but what is called the â€˜Inspectorâ€™ in Cubase.</p>

<p>DP allows you to section this in to 4 columns and it can be easily docked and moved around very nicely. I find it to be a much more efficient use of space than Cubaseâ€™s Inspector.</p>

<h2 id="the-command-window">The Command window.</h2>

<p>I <strong>love</strong> DPâ€™s command window. Having such quick access to shortcuts is so useful. I have the commands window docked so I can always see it. Often Iâ€™ll forget some weird rarely used shortcut and I can quickly search for it and go.</p>

<p>The Command windowâ€™s search is also <em>light years</em> better than Cubaseâ€™s keyboard commands search. Cubase shows you each result for the search one at a time. DP shows you all results as you type.</p>

<p>DP also has more functions mapped by default.</p>

<p>Huge winner here for someone like me that is obsessed with workflow and efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="the-consolidated-window-system">The consolidated window system</h2>

<p>Being able to dock any window I want is amazing. I hate floating windows and DP allows me to have <em>so much</em> information on screen very easily. Having to fuss with modal dialogs and always-on-top windows in Cubase to do certain functions is really annoying.</p>

<h1 id="digital-performer-the-bad-stuff">Digital Performer: The Bad Stuff</h1>

<h2 id="mixer">Mixer</h2>

<p>The mixer in DP is just inferior. Nothing like Cubaseâ€™s amazing Q-link, especially for inserting and controlling plugins. Resizing channels in DP is basically non-existent compared to Cubaseâ€™s excellent amount of control.</p>

<p>I really dislike the small faders in DPâ€™s mixer as well. Yes you can scroll-wheel to change values, but I like to click and drag. Scroll-wheeling hurts my finger.</p>

<h2 id="vcas">VCAs</h2>

<p>No VCAs. Man does that suck. The amount of extra work that this causes is ridiculous sometimes, and it makes managing automation much more difficult than it needs to be.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<p>DP is definitely buggier than Cubase in my experience. Neither one crashes very often (if at all), but there appears to be more things in DP that â€˜donâ€™t work rightâ€™.</p>

<h2 id="support-is-weird">Support isâ€¦ weird?</h2>

<p>Motuâ€™s support is awesome. Let me be totally clear about that. It used to suck big donkey balls, but they are doing awesome now.</p>

<p>The issue I have is that they are totally private. Itâ€™s rare to see someone from Motu out â€˜in the wildâ€™ helping someone out. Likewise itâ€™s rare to see them discussing their development openly, or discussing bugs orâ€¦ whatever.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a functioning closed system. After you experience Reaperâ€™s community, or Steinbergâ€™s, or RMLabs etcâ€¦ Motuâ€™s closed-doors feel rather odd.</p>

<h1 id="cubase-good-stuff">Cubase: Good stuff.</h1>

<h2 id="control-room">Control Room</h2>

<p>Read about the Control Room <a href="/music/2016/07/11/CubaSerenity.html">that I wrote about here</a></p>

<p>Now realize how you wish you had that in your DAW. You can setup something <em>similar</em> in DP with a bunch of extra channels and ridiculous routing. Itâ€™s stupid to try.</p>

<p>A killer feature of Cubase for sure.</p>

<h2 id="q-link">Q-Link</h2>

<p>Q-link is awesome. It makes any selected tracks in the mixer now a temporary group. This also affects inserting and modifying plugins.</p>

<p><strong><em>This is so cool</em></strong> if you use any sort of console emulation or tape plugin. You can quickly insert the same plugin on multiple tracks in the same slot and calibrate them to the same values.</p>

<p>It also makes it very nice to make various changes in the mix that donâ€™t necessarily require a permanent group.</p>

<h2 id="the-strip">The strip.</h2>

<p>The effect strip in Cubase is super useful. I love having the EQ and gate always at my fingertips. Iâ€™m also a magneto-fiend.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s entirely possible to setup a strip-like setup in DP by using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2631323401&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=t2YII15d45E&amp;v=XP3VYAujBAU">Track Templates</a> in DP, or you can use strip presets. I really wish this was the default, but I can also see how DPâ€™s method is more flexible.</p>

<p>I like how Cubase does this.</p>

<h2 id="metering">Metering</h2>

<p><a href="/music/2016/06/26/CubaSeductive.html">Cubaseâ€™s Metering that I wrote about</a> is so much better than DP.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s not much else to say. One of the most important aspects of audio production, and Cubase does it <em>significantly</em> better.</p>

<h2 id="vcas-1">VCAs</h2>

<p>Cubase has VCAs. Thatâ€™s it. I love VCAs.</p>

<h2 id="curveeq">CurveEQ</h2>

<p>Cubase comes with [CurveEQ]](http://www.voxengo.com/product/curveeq/). I love Voxengo products and I long since sold CurveEQ since I switched to using Pro-Q as my main go-to EQ.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve since realized once again how awesome [CurveEQ]](http://www.voxengo.com/product/curveeq/) is. I think Iâ€™d have to buy it again if I stay with DP.</p>

<h2 id="re-record">Re-record</h2>

<p>I canâ€™t tell you how much I love Re-Record in Cubase. Just press the record button to wipe what youâ€™ve recorded and immediately start over.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sure I can make some sort of system-based macro to do this in DP, but why should I have to?</p>

<h2 id="list-editor">List Editor</h2>

<p>Cubaseâ€™s list editor is so cool! Itâ€™s more than an event list. Itâ€™s like a piano roll mixed with a very functional event list.</p>

<p>I really like DPâ€™s event list (especially since it works so well with audio), but the List Editor in Cubase is super cool.</p>

<h2 id="audio-warping">Audio warping</h2>

<p>Audio warping in Cubase simply sounds <strong>way</strong> better than Digital Performer. Itâ€™s a huge difference.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s better in Studio One than either, but who wantâ€™s all that mess just for that? Gross.</p>

<h2 id="regular-updates">Regular updates</h2>

<p>Steinberg very regularly updates Cubase. Yes they are paid updates, but they are regular!</p>

<p>Motu on the other handâ€¦ You never know. Sometimes itâ€™s 2 years, sometimes 6 months. Sometimes it costs, sometimes not.</p>

<p>I like regular updates, and I donâ€™t mind paying people for their hard work.</p>

<h2 id="pan-law">Pan Law</h2>

<p>I like Cubaseâ€™s equal power pan law much better than DPâ€™s un-published pan law. This does make quite a difference when mixing.</p>

<h2 id="drum-replacement">Drum replacement</h2>

<p>Drum replacement with Cubase is very simple. Thereâ€™s various ways to do this in DP, but Cubase is much simpler and quicker in my experience.</p>

<h2 id="track-versions">Track Versions</h2>

<p>Track versions! Multiple versions of a track that doesnâ€™t require clobbering the takes function. You can have multiple comps, edits, performances etcâ€¦ and just switch between them easily.</p>

<h2 id="adding-busses">Adding busses</h2>

<p>In DP, to add a buss for multiple channels itâ€™s a 3 step process at minimum that involves 2 menus, a floating window, and it gets kinda confusing.</p>

<p>Cubase just has a very simple â€˜Add group channel to selected channelsâ€™. Easy, like it should be.</p>

<h1 id="cubase-the-not-so-great">Cubase: The not-so-great</h1>

<h2 id="regular-updates-1">Regular updates</h2>

<p>Yeah, I said I like it didnâ€™t I?</p>

<p>The issue is that they are regularly <em>paid</em> updates. This amounts to very nearly a subscription cost of ~$200 a year. Not so bad, but kinda crappy.</p>

<p><strong><em>update 8/2/2016</em></strong>: Wrong here. Itâ€™s between $50-100 per <em>year</em>. I messed up the dates for the updates.</p>

<h2 id="no-decent-track-template-system">No decent track template system</h2>

<p>No easy way just drop â€˜a drum setupâ€™ in to the project. Track archives come close, but they donâ€™t obey some routing and folders donâ€™t get captured.</p>

<h2 id="the-inspector">The inspector</h2>

<p>The inspector in Cubase kinda sucks. Itâ€™s 1 column and even if you sticky the things you use frequently, thereâ€™s still some rummaging that occurs with regular use.</p>

<p>If there was an option for at least a 2 column inspector with 2 narrow columns, Iâ€™d be very on-board with that.</p>

<h2 id="midi-editor">Midi editor</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve simply found the midi editor to be unintuitive. Very likely because Iâ€™m used to another software, but Iâ€™ve not experienced this feeling of frustration when using other software (S1, Reaper, Tracktion, Samplitude, Renoise, Logic and others!).</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t really quantify the issues I had. I just found myself referring to the manual more frequently than I wanted.</p>

<h2 id="the-included-plugins">The included plugins</h2>

<p>Kinda suck. Thereâ€™s not really much that stands out except CurveEQ and Magneto. DP has a whole plethora of plug-ins that are either excellent or worth using.</p>

<h2 id="the-ui">The UI</h2>

<p>I really dislike the UI in Cubase. The dark colour feeling never goes away. The hovering icons, the sliding drawers, the stupid awful floating windows.</p>

<p>Honestly, the only DAW GUI Iâ€™ve liked less was Logic. For the same reasonâ€™s too.</p>

<p>Even Studio One was more bearable to look at and use (assuming you disregard the whole drag&amp;drop thing).</p>

<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>

<p>Finding stuff in Cubaseâ€™s preferences is awful. Itâ€™s cluttered, oddly named, badly designed and thereâ€™s things <em>not</em> in preferences that you would think should be. (plug-in stuff, audio device settings)</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-commands">Keyboard commands</h2>

<p>Cubase is really short on default keyboard commands. Not only that but the search is <strong><em>AWFUL</em></strong>. Really awful. It simply shows you the next item in the list. Often you have to click a dozen times or more to <em>maybe</em> find the option that youâ€™re looking for. Thatâ€™s until you realize that itâ€™s called something else.</p>

<p>Not being able to have the keyboard commands window always open easily is not cool either.</p>

<h2 id="media-bay">Media bay</h2>

<p>The media bay is super awesome and useless.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s so much clutter for stuff I donâ€™t care about. If it was possible to get rid of all the loops, default categories, midi stuff etc.. then I would probably find it exceptionally useful. Oh, and itâ€™d need to have a working track template system too.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>There is none. Iâ€™m still trying to figure this out.</p>

<p>I thought writing all this down would help organize my thoughts and lead me closer to a conclusionâ€¦</p>

<p>Now Iâ€™m just more split.</p>

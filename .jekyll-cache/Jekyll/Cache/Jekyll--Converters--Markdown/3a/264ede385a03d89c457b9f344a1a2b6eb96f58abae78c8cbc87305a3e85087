I"ç<p>So a quick update on the Ardour adventure. I‚Äôve become rather distracted and done absolutely zero music tasks. Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In OS X, many windows are <em>always on top of everything</em>. So I‚Äôve been investigating this and discussing with the lead developer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figuring out why the preferences pane sometimes doesn‚Äôt draw at all‚Ä¶ and only finding how to reproduce it, not how to fix it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trying to figure out why various windows don‚Äôt correctly place themselves with dual monitors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing some lua-scripts to replace functionality that I‚Äôm used to in DP (or liked in Cubase).</p>

    <p>Subsequently, I‚Äôve ended up testing some new additions to the lua-api over the last few days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Performance on my machine is unusually poor with more than 1 processor selected. I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time trying to figure that out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning to build/package the OS X version, which I have working nicely now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figuring out why some tooltips show shortcuts, and some don‚Äôt.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now you may think that this will reflect poorly on my ‚Äòratings‚Äô, but I‚Äôve actually had quite a lot of fun. For a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù user that just wants things to work, Ardour would have been somewhat unpleasant so far. For me‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fun.</p>

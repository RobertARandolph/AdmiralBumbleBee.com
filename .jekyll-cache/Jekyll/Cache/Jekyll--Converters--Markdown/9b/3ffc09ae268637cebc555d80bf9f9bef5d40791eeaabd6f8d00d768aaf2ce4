<p>Today Iâ€™ll be discussing how to place Drum Overheads, and specifically what I think many people are â€˜doing wrongâ€™. This is largely in the context of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=glyn+johns+technique&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">the Glyn Johns technique</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=recorder+man+technique&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">the Recorderman Technique</a>, but it also applies to various other drum overheads miking techniques.</p>

<p>Before you get your jimmies rustled, let me say that <strong>thereâ€™s not really a â€œwrongâ€ way</strong>. Thousands of awesome sounding records have been made using a variety of wonky techniques. Whatâ€™s <em>really</em> important is that you capture the sound of the drumkit in a way that best represents the instrument in the context of the mix.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™m offering you is a geometric explanation of how to establish a good starting point, and explaining some potential snafus with various techniques.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also going to discuss how many people explaining this techniques do a somewhat poor job. Iâ€™ve gone through many videos and text descriptions and there seems to be common misconceptions that I wish to clear up.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to try to do my best to explain this mathematically, but also â€˜intuitivelyâ€™ (<a href="https://community.ardour.org/node/3322">whatever that means</a>). Thereâ€™s going to be 3 different explanations of the same topic. I hope one of them makes sense to you.</p>

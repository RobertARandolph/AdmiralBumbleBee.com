# WHY?

* No ADs **EVER** - I could easily be making a living wage off ads from this site. I don't because I hate ads.
* Responsible Disclosure - I always clearly note when products where given to me and encourage to reader to be skeptical of my findings.
* Unique Content - I actively try to avoid reproducing content that can be found elsewhere on the internet. If it's here then it's probably unique.
* Research - I do my best to do my due diligence.
* Responsive - I read (and respond to nearly) every comment/e-mail/message.
* Time - These articles take a lot of time! A single weekly article may take 20-50 hours of my time. A video may take 15-60 hours.
* Design - I actively avoid having an obnoxious looking website. I try to keep everything plain and easily discoverable. No obtrusive images, ads, weird javascript effects etc... I also make an effort to support accessibility and improve readability for all users.

And maybe you like the content too...

# How?

## Spread the Word

I don't advertise my content anywhere but on my twitter, and two discord servers where users ask me to.

If you want to help the site out, one of the best things you can do is point people to articles that may help them. If I have an article that might be beneficial to someone, then let them know.

## Feedback

Email me (audiolabs, gmail) or leave a comment on an article.

Any and all feedback is appreciate.

## Discord

Join the [discord chat server](https://discord.gg/34cFzVn) and chat with us.

## Donate

I appreciate your desire to donate. This helps me greatly in financing hosting costs, my time and the software/tools I use to create these posts. I put a lot of effort and money in to this project, so every penny counts.

Please be aware that there are, and never will be, ads on these page. I code all of my JS vanilla. I carefully optimize all images on the site. Videos usually have a poster. No auto-loading videos with sound. (I do use disqus for comments though!). _I value your bandwidth, time and intelligence._ This costs me extra time and money.

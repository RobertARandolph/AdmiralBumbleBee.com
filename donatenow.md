**THANK YOU!!**

I appreciate your desire to donate. This helps me greatly in financing hosting costs, my time and the software/tools I use to create these posts. I put a lot of effort and money in to this project, so every penny counts.

Please be aware that there are, and never will be, ads on these page. I code all of my JS vanilla. I carefully optimize all images on the site. Videos usually have a poster. No auto-loading videos with sound. (I do use disqus for comments though!). _I value your bandwidth, time and intelligence._ This costs me extra time and money.

[I also currently am without regular income]({% post_url 2018-06-09-Lets-talk-about-me-and-my-future %})

There are 2 ways to donate now! 

# Patreon

# [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/AdmiralBumbleBee)

By popular demand [you can now sign up on Patreon to support me](https://www.patreon.com/AdmiralBumbleBee). This allows you to create re-occurring payments at a value of your desire.

[Monthly payments](https://www.patreon.com/AdmiralBumbleBee) allow me have a stable and consistent income which allows me to schedule my time and resources regularly. This results in more consistent high-quality content.

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/AdmiralBumbleBee) supports are also capable of influencing the topics that I cover with a $25/mo donation. I put dozens (or more!) of hours in to many of these posts, so you're getting quite a cheap rate on my time ;)

# Paypal

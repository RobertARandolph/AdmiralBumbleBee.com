Hey. My name is Robert Randolph. If you've read [one of my recent posts]({% post_url 2018-06-09-Lets-talk-about-me-and-my-future %}) then you may realize that I'm looking for work.

I can provide a portfolio for interested employers on request, but here's a quick overview of what I can provide you:

* Decades of software testing experience
  * Largely Audio-Based software
  * I _enjoy_ writing detailed reports. (just look at this site, this is what I do for fun)
* Decades of management experience
  * Software development
  * Hardware development
  * Manufacturing
  * Delivery logistics
* Over a dozen years of international sales experience
* Extensive technical support capability on multiple platforms
* Development experience both as a hobby and on a professional scale
  * Clojure
  * Common Lisp
  * Java
  * C
    * AVR
    * PIC
    * X86
  * Javascript
    * Node
    * Client-side
  * Lua
  * Perl
  * DSP - release of multiple audio plugin products both personally and via contract
* Familiar with prototyping and manufacturing methods in a variety of materials

My previous work experience includes manufacturing management, international sales and support, running a recording studio and regional management of a large food chain.

The _only_ caveat is that I need to work remotely.

If you are interested in acquiring me as a contractor or employee please contact me via `audiolabs` at google's email service.

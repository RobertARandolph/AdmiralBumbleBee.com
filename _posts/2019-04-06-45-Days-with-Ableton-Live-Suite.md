Anyone that's familiar with me, [or the DAW Feature Chart](/DAW-Chart.html), probably thinks that **I dislike Ableton Live**.

**You'd be right**. I try to be as fair as possible in the DAW Feature Chart, but I personally have had a history of issues with Live.

I toured with Ableton Live (5-8) and was invested heavily in their products and third-party products, and _over and over and over and over and over_ I was either let down by the stability, or met resistance when trying to work with large projects or 'large tasks'.

I will be using Live 10.1(beta and release) for _at least_ the next 45 days. I will be using it for personal music creation and indulging my own curiosities. I will try to be as fair as possible, and I _strongly encourage_ anyone reading to speak up if you think I've made a mistake or have represented the product unfairly.

I hope to make this an interesting series. I'm going into this with fewer positive expectations than I've ever had.

**Other parts in this series**: 

{% assign lives = site.posts | where: "series", "ableton" | sort: 'date' %}
<ul>
{% for my_page in lives %} 
    {% if page.url != my_page.url  %}
        <li><a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ my_page.title | split: '-' | last }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

**VALID FOR LIVE 10.1**. Future updates may render some of this information invalid.

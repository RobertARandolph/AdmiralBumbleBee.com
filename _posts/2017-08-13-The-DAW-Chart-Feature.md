If you look in the menu you will see the [new DAW Chart](/DAW-Chart.html). It has a host of new features and will be evolving consistently.

Currently it's version 0.1. Rather than sitting on it trying to perfect it I am releasing the preliminary information so that I can receive feedback and improve it.

Currently I also need to re-code it as well, but that will come over time as I get ideas of new features to add to it.

I hope you enjoy it!

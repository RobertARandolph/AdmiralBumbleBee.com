This week I've updated some site features:

* Visual Assets - I commissioned [ToriBearArt](https://toribearart.wixsite.com/tbattv) to make some new branding assets for me. The first is shown above. It's a more complex rendition for larger format media. Some variations are in the works. I will be integrating the new branding over time, because I'm not a big fan of "relaunches" or "rebranding". I'll be making incremental changes and reacting to reader/viewer feedback as I go.
* Themes - I built support for multiple themes, with an indicator of the current theme. I choose 'cycling' between themes because I hate menus.
    * **WHITE** theme added.
    * Adjusted text color for dark theme.
* Various backend updates for my own sanity.
* [DAW Feature Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) updated.
    * Latest Versions
    * FL Modularity
    * Project Navigation->Information Hiding
    * Arranging category added
        * Project Navigation->Arrangement Tools moved to Arranging.
        * Added -
            * Time
            * Harmony
            * Sequencing
            * Key
    * **CAKEWALK REMOVED** - I have no desire to continue evaluating this software.
* [Reaper Script Showcase](/ReaperScripts.html) - Fixed some bad links and anchors.
    * Added [Fast FX Finder](/ReaperScripts.html#fast-fx-finder---thread)
    * Added [Wayback](/ReaperScripts.html#wayback---thread)
    * Added [Import Session Data](/ReaperScripts.html#import-session-data---thread)
    * Added [Quick Adder v2](http://127.0.0.1:4000/ReaperScripts.html#quick-adder---thread)
    * Note - I tried about a dozen new scripts, and many of them didn't work on macOS. It feels like the REAPER scripting community is becoming more OS-dependent by the day.
* [FreeBees](/FreeBees.html) - New FreeBees!
    * Added [LVC-Meter](https://lvcaudio.com/plugins/lvc-meter/)
* Drafts! - I've put work into 50-75% completed drafts of articles for periods when I'm feeling unwell, need a break, etc...
* Navbar adjusted to be cleaner.

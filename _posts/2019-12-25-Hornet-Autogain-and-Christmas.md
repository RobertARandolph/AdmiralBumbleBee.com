**NOTE**: The author replied in the comments asking me to make a support ticket, which I have done. I originally attempted to do this but it froze my browser. I have since found that my adblocking setup was causing this, which is clearly my issue.

This week I was trying to write a review/how-to on using [Hornet AutoGain Pro mk2](https://www.hornetplugins.com/plugins/hornet-autogain-pro-mk2/), however I spent about 15 hours _just trying to get it to work_.

I never managed to get it to work. Results were either:

* Nothing happens.
* Distorted.
* Display shows something, but the audio doesn't change.
* Something _does_ happen, but it's so subtle that I don't find value in it.

So I've scratched the review/how-to. I simply can't get the thing to work.

I can't say it's a bad product, but I can say that the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjJVZ-oVqnY&feature=emb_logo) is not helpful and there is no manual.

I generally like Hornet products (like [LUMeter]({% post_url 2018-11-30-Fast-Cheap-Easy-Youtube %}) and I find [Spaces](https://www.hornetplugins.com/plugins/hornet-spaces/) to be quite useful at times), but AutoGain Pro mk2 just doesn't do it for me.

156 screws. It only opens one way. At least 64 screws must be removed for it to open.

I sprayed it with the screws in so the slots are clogged, and made sure to use the lowest quality drywall screws I could find.

The gift inside is a lens adapter to use lenses he has with a camera he wants, but refused to buy himself.


Merry Christmas!

A small note that the [Reaper Script Showcase](/ReaperScripts.html) has been updated with a number of new scripts, videos and faster loading time!

There's also been some discussions about the [DAW Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) on [the Reaper forums](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=201226) and [vi-control.net](https://vi-control.net/community/threads/found-this-nice-daw-feature-comparison-chart.66997/). The feedback isn't always positive, but I'm constantly trying to improve relative to any feedback given.

The [DAW Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) has also received a number of updates due to these discussions.

If you have any questions, concerns, criticisms, rants or just wanna say thanks... please contact me! audiolabs via gmail.

**EDIT** - December 30th - I added a new Extensibility category and updated a few other ratings.

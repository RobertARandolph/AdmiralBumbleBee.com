description: DAW Chart Updated again!
---

Tiny post... the [DAW Feature Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) was updated to add Freezing features and an early addition of Scoring. The Scoring section will be slowly updated to include more fine-grained ratings, but for now it is a wholistic rating. I also added a new sub-category for 'Automation Tools'.

The Chart was updated for [Mixbus 4.3](http://mixbus.harrisonconsoles.com/forum/thread-5507.html), [Ableton Live 10](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) and [Cubase 9.5](https://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/what_is_new_in_cubase_95.html).

I also fixed some minor bugs in the script.

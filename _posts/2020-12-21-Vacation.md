I'm on Vacation until _at least_ January 2nd. That means no working on articles!

I'll be spending most of my time learning to use [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com), which has been an incredible boost to my productivity and well-being. Improving my Talon config is my #1 priority currently.

I'm currently paused on Day 24 [of the REAPER do-over series]({% post_url 2020-11-19-Starting-over-with-Reaper %}).

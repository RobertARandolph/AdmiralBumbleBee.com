So rather than a '30 days with...', I'm instead going to do a '4 articles with'. That should amount to 30-45 days of usage.

What am I using primarily this time? [Cubase 10](2018-11-14-Cubase-10-update).

So I'll be focusing on some things that I like/dislike in Cubase, along with some general commentary and maybe some tips/tricks?

I won't be covering [anything that I've covered already](/tags/#Cubase). Only new stuff.

Read more if you want to know why there's no 'real' article this week, and why there may not be one next week.

# Life

[Get yourself up to date on my general health situation first]({% post_url 2018-06-09-Lets-talk-about-me-and-my-future %}).

I've always had the occasional migraine, I think everyone deals with them at some point. Recently, likely due to my autonomic failure, I've had a string of 12 days with a migraine lasting more than 8 hours. I can deal with that for the most part. I schedule my time around it, I have medication, I have [a headache hat](https://www.amazon.com/Headache-Hat-Original-Wearable-Headaches/dp/B00FGWLDR6) (for real, that thing is AMAZING), I have [caffeine](https://www.makeitmio.com/en/energy) etc... It sucks, but I can deal with it.

There's two things I haven't been able to deal with though:

* Medication changes or inability to acquire medication due to insurance - This is a constant issue.
* [Cluster Headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache).

I drove to [my favorite guitar store](https://www.replayguitar.com) a couple weeks ago and while crossing a large bridge I experienced what I can only describe as the most incredible pain I can imagine. It shot up the back of my head to my eye socket. The pain went from 0-60 in what felt like seconds. It was the sort of pain where your eyes are wide open, but you can't see anything.

I was barely able to pull over. (Of course it's on a bridge with one of those tiny lanes where you think you're going to be smashed to pieces because your car barely fits. The thought of being turned into a discarded soda can was passing through my head between pulses of pain.)

I couldn't even put together the thought of using my phone to call someone. All I could think of was [FAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAST_(stroke)) over and over. Not long after it started, I had the presence of mind to open the car door before I vomited from the pain. It's funny how little things like not puking all over yourself can seem like a triumph in certain circumstances. Just a flash of, "Nice, one less thing to deal with right now."

Between 5-10 minutes later I felt better, though with some [postdrome symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4955275/). I checked myself a number of times for stroke-like symptoms, then stupidly I zipped down the freeway to get home.

After that day I had a number of [silent migraines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acephalgic_migraine). I've experienced these in the past, and my migraines almost always come with an aura, so I wasn't particularly alarmed.

Then I experienced more intense headaches, and more moderate migraine-like pain I mentioned earlier.

Meanwhile my [neuropathic symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_fiber_peripheral_neuropathy) ([or not?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia)) increased in intensity. Thankfully I was able to get into a neurologist (specializing in neuropathy with a somewhat obsessive interest in migraine treatment). It's seeming likely that [the usually benign twitches I showed before]({% post_url 2019-03-24-This-Week %}#health) are caused by something else.

It's no surprise that a neurologist suspects a linked neurological cause for everything, but I'm on board. I'm like anyone else... I am ready to accept the unlikely outcome that a number of defects are caused by the same root cause. No matter how unlikely it is, my readiness to accept a single root cause far exceeds the possibility that it is the correct assessment.

I was told that cluster headaches (and "normal" migraines) were commonly co-morbid with certain causes of peripheral neuropathy _and_ autonomic dysfunction. So now I have 7 pages of tests to complete (4-5 tests per page) in the next month before going in for a series of biopsies and autonomic testing. That's likely to just be the start.

**PLUS** potentially starting an incredibly expensive monthly [shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galcanezumab) for the headaches.

For the last 2 weeks I've used _nearly_ every moment of my free (cognitively clear) time to do work for an employer. Luckily I greatly enjoy the work, and it cheered me up a bit. I take pride in my work, and my efficiency and being able to execute at a level I felt comfortable with was a welcome change of pace. I used any extra time I had to read technology books and [play with nim](https://nim-lang.org). I fit in a couple hours of a [video game that I've been playing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Vesperia) as well.

I used my moderate-level migraine time to help manage a competition/[Q&A]({% post_url 2019-07-13-Interview-with-Kilohearts %}) with [Kilohearts](http://kilohearts.com) on the [discord that I help adminstrate](http://discord.gg/edmp).

# So what?

My last 2 articles were prepared well in advance so I was able to cover my lack of well-being with some (hopefully) interesting content, but at this point I have no more completed content to put out.

I loathe to miss a weekly article, [even though I already said I might before]({% post_url 2018-11-18-Site-Updates %}), but I might end up doing it so that I can focus my productive time on higher priority endeavors.

Then again... I said that before and I think I've done pretty well (and had lots of fun doing it).

description: Another DAW Chart update!
---

The [DAW Feature Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) has been updated yet again with a Live Performance section.

Many of the features necessary for live performance are covered already, like stability, but I've added a few ratings that focus on the _ease_ and power of certain features.

The default weight is 0. I have the default set as it matters to me, and currently I do not do live performance.

I've also changed the default weights since my [recent focus has changed a bit]({% post_url 2018-06-09-Lets-talk-about-me-and-my-future %}). I changed ratings for [Bitwig](/tags/#Bitwig) and [Waveform](/tags/#Waveform). The Bitwig ratings will be changing even more soon... for reasons you'll find out in a bit over a week ;)

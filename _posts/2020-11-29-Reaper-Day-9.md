Short post today to design the MIDI Editor interactions to my liking.

This is all text, and ideas for my interaction with the MIDI editor on a fairly basic level. I'm posting this to get feedback and let myself sit on it before I start changing a bunch of actions.

{% assign reaperover = site.posts | where: "series", "reaperover" | sort: 'date' %}
<ul>
{% for my_page in reaperover %} 
    {% if page.url != my_page.url and my_page.layout != "reader" %}
        <li><a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ my_page.title | split: '-' | last }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

# Introduction

If you've read the previous posts then you'd know that I prefer working 100% keyboard if possible. This means that I need a few general commands:

* Reset - Go back to a known state, regardless of the current state
* Cursor Movement - Ways to quickly move the cursor to a point
  * I don't want to be pressing the arrow key 40 times to get somewhere. < 3 (nearby!) key presses should get me to 80% locations.
* Selections - Select notes:
  * Relative to the current selection.
  * Relative to the cursor.
  * Inside a time selection.
* Data movement - Move a note to common places. 
  * [Moving in thirds offers a reasonable compromise](#thirds)
  * Input via MIDI is a much better option.
* Place a note at the current cursor position.
  * Via MIDI
  * Computer keyboard, at a given octave.
* Split notes
  * At cursor
    * Only selected notes?
  * At time selection
    * Only selected notes?
* Change note length
  * All selected notes to cursor
  * Nearest selected note to cursor, all others expanded by that delta.
  
I'm not considering MIDI cc, as I believe that's almost universally best input via mouse or MIDI controller. I may change my mind at some point though.

# A note on note movement

**NOTE** - Assuming [12-tet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament), because that's all I work in anymore.

I'm a believer in composability of keyboard commands, which implies some sort of grammar.

Start with a set of clear, non-complex commands, then build up larger actions from these commands. Western music allows me (us?) to build a dictionary of 4 commands:

* Semitone
* Octave
* Minor Third
* Major Third

## Thirds

Most western harmony is built on thirds, and even when it isn't -  it is. Let me go through every interval up to 13ths and map out the use of the previous 4 commands: 

* (**s**)emitone - 1 semitone shift.
* (**O**)ctave - 11 semitone shift.
* Major (**T**)hird - 3 semitone shift.
* Minor (**t**)hird - 4 semitone shift.

Now how these can be composed for quickly moving notes using the letter in the parentheses. + for shift up in pitch, - for shift down in pitch.

Any of these commands can be executed in any order, and b9 and higher are the same, but with **O** prefixed.

1. Minor 2nd - s+
2. Major 2nd - s+ s+
3. Minor 3rd - t+
4. Major 3rd - T+
5. Perfect 4th - T+ s+
6. Aug 4th/Dim 5th - t+ t+
7. Perfect 5th - T+ t+
8. Aug 5th - T+ T+
9. Major 6th - O+ t- **or** T+ t+ s+
10. Dominant 7th - O+ s- s- **or** T+ t+ t+
11. Major 7th - O+ s-
12. Octave - O+

The worst case scenario is the dominant 7th, and 9th to 15th with 3 key presses. With some practice it should be possible to type these approximately as fast as reaching to grab the mouse or a single command with modifier keys.

This is a form of [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), I guess a quaternary search?

### Not Thirds

I hope the astute reader was rolling their eyes a bit at the last part. What's easier than the above? **Playing it on an instrument**.

The major of input will be from the piano for me, however there are times where I will want to select a note and make a small change *or* when I want to work on my laptop.

I will be setting this up though!

# Step Input

{:/nomarkdown}

Most DAWs have some concept of "Step Input". The idea is that cursor control is driven by input, and cursor movement and note length are controlled by a grid value.

* Either:
  * Input on MIDI controller
    * Note is created at grid length (or separate note length parameter)
  * Input command (or out of the way MIDI note) that either:
    * Moves the cursor forward by the grid amount **or**
    * Moves the cursor backward by the grid amount.
* Cursor moves by grid length
* Input new note **or**
  * Change grid size.
  
As a bonus I like if I have some way to:

* Select notes at cursor via MIDI
* Input MIDI data (cc/pitch/etc...) at cursor.
  * Optionally interpolate data between nearest two points to the cursor

Then I'm quite happy.

# Temporal movement

It's time for time!

Once again, n-division narrowing buys us a lot of functionality with few commands:

* Jump - Move to an arbitrary time or a time >3 bars away.
* Move to start of measure
* Move by grid (!)
* Move to nearest pitch by pitch-class

## Grid

The existence of a grid simplifies cursor movement, _and_ [note length](#note-length) _and_ [selection](selection).

I generally only use the following grid positions, which I believe are enough to get to the common locations in 3 or fewer key presses.

* **1** measure
* 1/**2**
* 1/**4**
* 1/4t - **5** (one key above 1/4)
* 1/**8**
* 1/8t - **9** (one key above 1/8)
* 1/1**6**
* 1/16t - **7** (one key above 1/16)
* 1/**3**2

The bolded number is the hotkey I use, this is non negotiable since I already use these in other DAWs.

(Note that triplets are DivisionNumber+1.)

# Selection

Thus far I've discussed topics that allow me to work on individual notes in some manner (besides piano input). MIDI editing and input require working on multiple notes at a time which means some method of marking notes to be worked on.

There's two dimensions of selection necessary:

* Time
* Pitch, or "notes"

Time is contiguous in most linear DAWs, so I won't concern myself with multiple time selections.

Note selection is often non-contiguous. I believe the best method is to have a method of selecting all notes at the cursor via MIDI input. If that's not an option, then I will need to rethink.

# Note Split

Note split can happen with a time selection or at the cursor. There are two types of selections:

* Pitch - Split all notes selected by pitch at the cursor.
* Time - In/Out points should split all pitch selected notes at the cursor.

I'd like "At cursor" and "At selection" to be separate commands. I don't think that I'll use different selection commands such as "at start", "at end" and "both".

# Note Length

Given a number of selected notes, it should be possible to do two actions:

* Move the end of all notes to the cursor.
* Find the note off nearest to the cursor:
  * Determine the distance between that note-off and the cursor.
  * Adjust all selected note lengths by that amount.

# Summary

This is a brain dump of thoughts about MIDI note editing. Almost all of these apply to item editing as well.

I welcome comments about things I missed or ideas to explore.

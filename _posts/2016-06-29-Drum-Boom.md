I became annoyed with having a 3ft boom sticking out from the left side of my drumset. So I hopped on the lathe and made a smaller boom out of [Sapele](http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/sapele/).

5/8"-27tpi threads in wood really are a pain. Luckily I have [the correct die](http://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/03936275) for the job.

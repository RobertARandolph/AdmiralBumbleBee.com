Well, [Ardour 5.0 has been released](https://ardour.org/whatsnew.html) and honestly it looks pretty good. So for this next month, I will be using Ardour as much as possible.

It will be added to my [DAW Comparison chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Gvq6d4qXsxwpUmpZcCfpMF7Pt6zycktWr9wGb_SxRE/edit?usp=sharing) and I will blog my evaluation of various aspects as I experience it.

Here we go!

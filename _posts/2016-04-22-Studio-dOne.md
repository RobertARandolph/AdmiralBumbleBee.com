![Not anymore!](/assets/Studio Done/nope.jpg)
 
That's it. I'm done with Studio One for now.

I wish I could have continued this blog about my evaluation of it, but the number of crashes I've encountered is just mind-boggling. A lot of these crashes are reproducible and in areas that surely are commonly used.

I also really miss chunks, POLAR, the commands window, the _huge_ number of useful commands for navigating, far superior zooming capabilities and some of the MOTU plugins that are included. Especially the Masterworks Leveler.

Maybe I'll try it again at version 3.5 or something. I don't know. Good luck to Presonus.

I'm taking a bit of a break this half-week before I finish my [Mixbus 32c](http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus32c.html) Review.

I have made some updates to the [Reaper Script Showcase](/ReaperScripts.html) and the [DAW Feature Chart](/DAW-Chart.html). The DAW Feature chart has had a number of updates based on feedback from users. I'm not infallible! If you think I've made a mistak then please speak up.

I've also had some direct interaction with DAW Developers informing me of features that I may or may not know about, and some scores have been changed based on that feedback (betters **and** worse).

So meanwhile, check out those features and let me know what you think in the comments or via e-mail!

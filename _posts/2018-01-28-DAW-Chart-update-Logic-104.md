The [DAW Feature Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) has been updated for Logic 10.4, Bitwig 2.2.3, Pro Tools 2018.1 and Mixbus 4.3.

Since the ratings are relative to each other, many ratings have changed. When one product improves, other ratings may be reduced to reflect the relative capability in that category.

Once again! This is a reminder that **the chart doesn't communicate how "good" a DAW is**. It's just a _feature_ chart. A DAW may offer a fantastic workflow that provides all the features that you need.

Let me know if you have any questions!

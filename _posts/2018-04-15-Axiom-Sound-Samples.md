description: Sound samples for Blue Cat Axiom
---

There's going to be a plethora of amazing sound examples out in the coming weeks for Axiom, but I think I can provide you a unique experience with [my comparator]({% post_url 2017-01-30-Comparator %}). That means that all of these sounds are LUFS normalized to -18dB LUFS for better comparison.

I'll do a few styles of guitar, some bass, some drums and some synth processing. These samples don't come remotely close to covering what Axiom is capable of, but it's something to whet your appetite.

I've tried to keep the riffs simple. I also left in the finger noises, buzzing and other bits. There was no editing or corrective effects applied at all.

Each example will have notes about the guitar used, and a dry clip that you can reference against. I am not using presets here. I created most of these from scratch, so you're hearing partially my tastes and Axiom's capability.

Sound samples are recorded in to a [Focusrite Clarett 8PreX](https://us.focusrite.com/thunderbolt-audio-interfaces/clarett-8prex) using the instrument input or using a self-made DI box using a [Lundahl 1935 transformer](http://www.lundahl.se/wp-content/uploads/datasheets/1935.pdf).

# Bass

A note: all of my bass guitars have flatwound strings. This has a considerable effect on the tone presented. You can listen to the dry samples to get an idea of what the effected versions are based off.

# Drums

## Drums

Ddrum Custom with Variety of Zildjian cymbals.

Tempo: 125bpm

Kick: [Heil PR-40](https://heilsound.com/products/pr-40/)
Snare Top: [SM57 Transformerless](https://tapeop.com/tutorials/52/sm-57-mod/)

Overheads: [Audio Technica ATM450](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/3ecd2aeacfd0d8b3/)
Room: [AEA R84](https://www.aearibbonmics.com/products/r84-series/)

Notes: This is an unmixed drum part. Straight off the mics. No compression, no EQ, no anything.

I threw in a part with a quick mix of the drums using only Axiom instances. I have no musical context to put this in, so it's a bit hard to come up with something inspiring.

There's also 3 files of just the room mic.

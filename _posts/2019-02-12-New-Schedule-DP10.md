[Digital Performer 10](http://motu.com/newsitems/digital-performer-10-is-now-shipping) is out! That's awesome, and normally I'd be blasting you with content **RIGHT NOW**.

_But I'm not._ Yet.

It's coming soon...

Forcing myself to publish weekly has really cramped me hard. I end up with spare time sitting on drafts I don't care about, or I end up spending 18 hours on Friday and 18 hours on Saturday to torture myself.

I really miss doing short "tips" type things that I can't fit in with the weekly style, because I need to focuse on my deadline. I want to do more of those again. I also want the freedom to indulge in random curiosities I dive into on a whim, and write as I do so.

So the next article is coming when it's ready. Every article after that will come when it's ready. The total content should _increase_ and it will likely still be ~4 posts a month. The time between articles will be variable though.

(Also 15th [wedding anniversary coming up](https://www.paypal.me/admiralbumblebee)... So ya'll get to wait while I enjoy that this week.)

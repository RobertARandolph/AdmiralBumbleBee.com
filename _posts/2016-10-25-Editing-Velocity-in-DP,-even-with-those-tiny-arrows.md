DP has some issues with _really_ __really__ tiny UI elements sometimes. Midi note velocity is among the worst offenders, and a lot of users struggle editing note data because of this.

So I made a quick tutorial showing a better way of editing midi velocity data than struggling with the arrows, using the event list or some other methods.

This will probably get lost with the [Waveform article coming out simultaneously]({% post_url 2020-05-08-Waveform-11-Pro %}), but the following updates have been made to the site:

* Index page headers/images are clickable - I can't believe how long I went without realizing most people click the image to go to an article!
* Theme color boxes are clickable to jump to a theme.
* Changes to scripts for creating posts.
* Improved image template for post header images.
* Edited metadata for a number of posts.
* Researched alternatives to Youtube - Probably needs to be a post of its own.
* Support auto-outlining.
* Omnigraffle templates concepts for future articles.

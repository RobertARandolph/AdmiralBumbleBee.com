Let me start this out by being totally clear: This is not the first time I've used [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/). I've used Logic 9 and Logic Pro X for 100s (1000s?) of hours in the past. _However_, I've never blogged my experiences using it, and I've never used it as my primary and _only_ DAW for any significant period of time.

That starts now! For the next 30 days I will be using only [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/). I will be covering things I normally cover like: [my first impressions]({% post_url 2017-06-04-Bitwig-first-impressions %}), [features I really like]({% post_url 2016-06-26-CubaSeductive %}), [things I really dislike]({% post_url 2016-12-16-Things-I-hate-about-Digital-Performer %}), and [reviews of included content]({% post_url 2017-09-30-Review-of-Mixbus-effect-plugins %}).

I don't have much to cover now. I've already spent ~12 hours converting projects, reading the _entire_ Logic manual (twice) and re-familiarizing myself with the shortcuts. Soon will come a more in-depth post.

[![All done!](/assets/Knob/Thumbnails/done.jpg)](/assets/Knob/done.jpg)

I have a [Focusrite Saffire Pro 40](https://us.focusrite.com/firewire-audio-interfaces/saffire-pro-40) that is setup as part of my live rig. To change the master volume, it requires that I reach down and blindly grab the correct one of about 30 knobs. If you haven't guessed, I rarely get it.

The solution is simple. Make a bigger knob out of sapele, of course.

# Begin!

First thing we need to do is start with a block of wood. A nice piece of Sapele will do it. I measured and found that a 1" knob will fit nicely and be quite large in context.

# Turn

Now I chuck it up in the lathe to get the profile I want.

# Drill

There needs to be a center hole for this D-shaped knob shaft to go. I toss my drill chuck in the lathe tailstock and get going.

# It's almost a knob!

Get that nasty square part off...

# Give it the D, part 1

First step to making the D hole is to cut a little sliver of wood. In this case it's exactly 1mm thick.

Now it needs to be trimmed to the correct width with a sharp chisel. Note that you need to go WITH the grain. If you go against it, then it will split in a way you don't want. _Pay attention to the grain!_


[![Slice it down](/assets/Knob/Thumbnails/slice.jpg)](/assets/Knob/slice.jpg)

Now the back of the slice needs to be rounded so it fits nicely in the hole.


[![Round it up.. up I guess? Last thing was down, so this must be up](/assets/Knob/Thumbnails/roundslice.jpg)](/assets/Knob/roundslice.jpg)

# Give it the D, part 2

Cover the slice in some medium viscocity CA, insert and then spray with some accelerator.

Trim it down to look nice

# Some Indication

A centerfinder is used to line up the 'indication point' on the face. The flat face of the D shaft points perpendicular to the indication mark.

I then took a V chisel and cut the indication mark on the face.

# Finish

CA as finish! The pen turner's favorite thing. I like to apply it with [Kimwipes](http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Clark-Kimtech-Kimwipes-Delicate-Disposable/dp/B00RORBXA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460401922&sr=8-1&keywords=kimwipes). These things are my favorite finish application product now. 

[![Yeah, I use this stuff. It works quite well and it's quick.](/assets/Knob/Thumbnails/cathin.jpg)](/assets/Knob/cathin.jpg)

# Finished

Only took about 30 minutes. It will probably save me that much time fumbling around in just a few days.


[![That's it!. Please look at the plastic and the bubbles. FEEL IT. FEEEEELLLLL IIIITTTTTTT](/assets/Knob/Thumbnails/done.jpg)](/assets/Knob/done.jpg)

Yes, I keep the plastic on all my stuff. _Deal with it._

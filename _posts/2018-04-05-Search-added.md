I've added a [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) site search to this website.

If you see the search box in a seemingly weird place, then you need to clear your browser cache. Usually holding control (Win) or command (mac) then pressing `Refresh` (usually F5) will do that.

Please read about [why I used DuckDuckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy). They also do not host ads for competing websites in my search results by default, where as google has no way to turn off ads in search results. I hate ads. Eww.

Thanks as always for reading!

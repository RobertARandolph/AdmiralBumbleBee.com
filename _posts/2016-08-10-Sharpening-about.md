Aftermath of trying out some freehand 25Â° bevel honing on some [Neiko Chisels](https://www.amazon.com/Neiko%C2%AE-02628A-Carving-Chisel-9-Piece/dp/B003X5KF04/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470857908&sr=8-1&keywords=neiko+chisel). I'm using [Shapton Kuromaku](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_12?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=shapton+kuromaku&sprefix=Shapton+kuro%2Ckitchen%2C151) stones at #320, #1000, #5000, #8000, #12000. Stones are flattened with a [DMT Dia-Sharp Coarse](https://www.amazon.com/DMT-D8X-Continuous-Diamond-Extra-Coarse/dp/B001DZOKNY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470858433&sr=8-1&keywords=diasharp+course) and I use [HoneRite Gold](http://www.woodcraft.com/product/152586/honerite-gold-250-ml.aspx) on the #8000 and #12000 stones to reduce oxidation.

I returned my [Narex Classic Bevel-Edge Chisels](http://www.leevalley.com/US/Wood/page.aspx?p=67707&cat=1,41504) to Lee Valley due to unusually poor edge retention. They accepted the return 3 months out of the return period _and_ after a reasonable amount of use. Very classy.

So for now, all I have are these very cheap [Irwin Marples](https://www.amazon.com/Marples-Woodworking-Chisel-6-Piece-M444SB6N/dp/B000RG2Y56) OEM/rip-offs to play with. And play with them I shall...

Hide glue is awesome stuff. I use [Behlen Hide Glue](http://www.amazon.com/Ground-Hide-Glue-1-Pound/dp/B003AYTJSC) and my glue pot setup is very cheap and very effective. For $15 you can have a fantastic hide glue setup...

# Buy it

The key is buying 2 cheap items. A [SCR-200 Small Crock-Pot](http://www.target.com/p/crock-pot-2-quart-manual-slow-cooker-scr200/-/A-16799398) and [Ball Half Pint Mason Jars](http://www.target.com/p/ball-half-pint-8-oz-mason-jar-set-of-12/-/A-14898081). Target usually has the best prices on these two items. I purchased my Crock-Pot on sale for $7.99.

# Use it

All you need to do is mix your glue in the ball jar and set it in the [Crock-Pot](http://www.target.com/p/crock-pot-2-quart-manual-slow-cooker-scr200/-/A-16799398) with the temperature set to low.

# Prove it

The [SCR-200](http://www.target.com/p/crock-pot-2-quart-manual-slow-cooker-scr200/-/A-16799398) set to "Low" keeps the water at a perfect ~140°f-145°f temperature. It takes about ~15 minutes to bring the glue up to consistency from a room temperature state.

# Bonus it?

Bonus tip #1: The first time that I put the glue in to the [Crock-Pot](http://www.target.com/p/crock-pot-2-quart-manual-slow-cooker-scr200/-/A-16799398), I use an [Aicok Water Boiler](http://www.amazon.com/Aicok-1-7-liter-Variable-Temperature-Stainless/dp/B018Z6Q9A0?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01) with the temperature set to 160°f. I pour that from about 2ft up in to the [Crock -Pot](http://www.target.com/p/crock-pot-2-quart-manual-slow-cooker-scr200/-/A-16799398) and set it to low. The water temp is practically perfect after the high pour. Stir it every 20 minutes, and you have a fresh batch of glue within an hour.

Bonus tip #2: A 2:1 ratio of water to glue **by weight** offers an excellent working glue.

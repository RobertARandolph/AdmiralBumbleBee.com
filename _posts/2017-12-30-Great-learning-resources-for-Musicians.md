A [very nice user](https://soundcloud.com/tainmere) has created [a selection of resources for musicians learning production](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14DO-5RdZToFe3fzwf2Ya53-yW_QewqhtI0Gcigt4liE/edit#gid=86435323).

I strongly suggest checking it out above and seeing if there's any resources that you may not be familiar with.

You can contact the author [on twitter](https://twitter.com/Tainmere) or [on discord](discord.gg/edmp) as user `Tainmere#1284`.

p.s. I am not very good at taking breaks. Can you tell?

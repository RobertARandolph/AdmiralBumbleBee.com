Just a small update so my readers know why I haven't written much in the last 2 months:


* Exhaustion - Working 8-10 hours a day writing software and documentation means that my physical ability to continue writing on my website is diminished.
  * I use speech to text most of the day, and after 7-10 hours I'm already mentally _and orally_ fatigued from the process. I need to switch my mental process to something else.
  * Simply sitting in front of a computer all day curtails my appetite for engaging with a computer screen in my off hours.
* Software - I was unable to build and deploy this site for 6 weeks because of a dependency issue with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on my system. I spent nearly 30 hours trying to figure it out, including attempting to completely nuke ruby from my system. Demoralizing and vexing.
  * I **STILL** don't know what's wrong. I'm on a new computer that seems to work.
    * Not being able to properly write on the same system that I do most of my music/hobby work on makes it difficult to stay motivated to write new content.
* Pneumonia - I spent this last 2 weeks (one of which was supposed to be my vacation!) with bacterial pneumonia. As of this post it is still not fully cleared.
  * I suggest against having pneumonia. It is _quite_ unpleasant.
* Disenchantment - Not burnout, I still love toying around with audio software, taking notes, testing etc... However, my desire to publish my thoughts to the public has been atrophied. It's a combination of oral fatigue, nasty e-mails, shrinking communities (or moving to new platforms?) and a more fulfilling dayjob.
  * I would say that 95% of this website is a result of me being bored with the work or time I spent working on audio engineering tasks. I'm _not_ bored during the day anymore (and I don't work primarily on audio/music). Fulfillment happens elsewhere. The yearning to fill in the gaps with writing is nullified, I fill in the gaps as part of my daily working process now.
* It might sound silly, but the [Digital Performer 11](https://motu.com/en-us/store/catalogue/digital-performer-11_489/#502) update was depressing, in the literal sense. When that was released, I simply lost all interest in audio software as a concept. I've plugged along using Logic Pro X without a single thought of 'software'. I'm not sure I've surmounted that psychological hurdle yet. What a rubbish update, and if that's what people truly want then well...
  
I've been working through my thoughts to come up with an adaptation to these changes. It's a slow process, as I'm continually skeptical of each supposed epiphany, conclusion or burst of motivation.

That said, I still have 2 more Mixbus posts to finish :) I will be updating the site features ([DAW Chart](/DAW-Chart.html), [DAW Wants](/DAW-Wants.html) and [FreeBees](/FreeBees.html)) as time and pneumonia recovery permit.

Along with this post, I've _hopefully_ fixed the issue with the header system. Interviews should display correctly.

The [Health](/health/) page has been updated with information about my leg braces and some lifestyle changes. I've also updated pharmaceutical information for migraines.

This post took:

* 30 hours to screw with Ruby, and fail.
* 12 hours to come up with a workable solution to the header issue on interviews and long-winded topics.
* 2 hours to update the [Health page](/health/)
* 3 hours to get distracted and mess with Digital Performer 11 again. It's still hooey.
* 1.75 hours to write this.

I've updated the [DAW Feature Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) with some big rating changes. Mixbus is finished for V4.2. I added a couple new categories as well. Reaper was lowered in some areas (oh no!).

I also updated all of the old DAW Chart posts with a link to the new version.

All of the categories/sections have links that link to an explanation of what that rating considers.

If you have any suggestions or questions about ratings, please leave a comment or e-mail me. Thank you!

I've been doing a number of [Live Streams](/tags/#Live+Stream) making some leather strops, and now they are [for sale on my Etsy store! along with some cool wood combs](https://www.etsy.com/shop/AdmiralBumbleBee).

Parts 4 and 5 of the streams are linked after the break as well. So check those out if you're curious.

[My etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/AdmiralBumbleBee) will be linked in my nav bar up top soon, but for now this is the announcement.

**BUY BUY BUY BUY**

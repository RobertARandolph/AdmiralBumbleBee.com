Time for some site updates!

I wanted to add more "Site Features" (static pages that are constantly updated) and I was running out of room in the nav. I also frequently receive complaints about how textually busy the site update is. I've aimed to improve both of these problems with this update.

* Removed Google Analytics
  * The only remaining external javascript dependency is disqus... that will be the next target.
* New site layout!
  * Site Nav - I found the site nav difficult to use.
    * Increased size of elements
    * Increased size of header
    * Removed busy recent/tag sidebars(!) - It is an extra click, but I've never felt that they present the information well.
    * Added simple left-nav
      * It sucked when I made it.
      * Wife helped me make it not suck.
    * Move tags year/type widget
  * Post Layout
    * Adjusted header spacings.
    * Allowed header to gracefully fail on different viewport sizes
    * Remove section hierarchy in posts
    * Add dynamic in-page breadcrumbs
      * On desktop as you scroll, the current header and sub-headers attache to the top of the screen to display your reading position in the outline.
      * This breaks all of the [interviews pages](/tags/?year=false#Interviews). I'm aware. I don't have a fix yet.
  * Pagination is back.
    * I set it to paginate in 20... but it's only showing 10. I'm skeptical. Please let me know if it's broken :)
  * Each post has a previous/next post button at the botton now.
  * Themes
    * New Theme Color - Dark Green!
    * Updated theme pickers with indicator
    * Yellow theme is now darker
    * Theme color boxes are a bit more desaturated and more accurate.
  * Cleanup
    * Fixed a number of tags
    * Fixed all sorts of weird stuff I missed
      * My wife found them, thank you.
* New feature!
  * [Health](/health/) - I get a few e-mails a week about my health, so I thought I'd put up a full page about it. My hope is that this disclosure will help other people with similar problems navigate their options and know they are not alone.
* Updated [About page](/about/)
* Updated [Favourites](/Favourites.html) - specifically the [EDC section](/Favourites.html#every-day-carry) (and some other minor updates)
* Added "Last Updated" to all static pages.

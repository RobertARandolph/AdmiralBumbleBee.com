I have RSI issues at times, particularly when doing any graphics work or heavy audio editing that requires mouse usage.

What happens is that I seem to grip my mouse extra hard when I try to make small movements. I've spent years trying to consciously remember to avoid this, but it is both difficult to move the cursor as I want and not squeeze the mouse.

I've decided to do _at least_ 1 week of setting my mouse to half-dpi. That means I'm going from 1650 to 825. I've also setup my games (such as [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/)) to be using half sensitivity now as well, except with a higher DPI setting.

Hopefully this reduces strain when making small movements and encourages me to use larger and stronger muscle groups when moving the mouse.

Meanwhile, I have 2 more large Studio One blog posts in the works.

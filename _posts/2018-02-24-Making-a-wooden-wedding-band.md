My wife does not have a wedding band. We've been together since 2000, and she's never had one. So I'm going to see if I can make one.

I've never made a ring before and I did zero research on how to do this. I just put some thought power in to it and then whacked at some wood.

Here's my process...

# Starting

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Starting.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Starting.jpg" alt="Starting">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Starting</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

To start I grab some [Peruvian Walnut](http://www.wood-database.com/peruvian-walnut/), some [Hard Maple](http://www.wood-database.com/hard-maple/) and some more hard maple.

My plan is to laminate these together then chop the laminate perpendicular to the longest dimension. This will give my a piece that I can make the ring from.

# Slice

</a>
<div class="image-caption">Slice</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I want the ring to have a strip of light maple in between the dark walnut. So I need to create a thin strip of maple

I setup my [Bandsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandsaw) to take a very thin cut.

This took me 3 tries to get it right. I went by eye until I was satisfied with the strip.

# Smooth

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Smooth.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Smooth.jpg" alt="Smooth">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Smooth</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

In between cuts I always smoothed one side with my [Veritas Bevel-Up Smoother Plane](http://www.leevalley.com/us/Wood/page.aspx?p=51870&cat=1,41182,41187&ap=1).

This guarantees that one side of the strip will not need any sanding, and it gives me a good reference face to press against the fence when cutting.

# Strips

<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Strips.jpg" alt="Strips">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Strips</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

These are the 3 strips I cut.

# Inches

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Inches.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Inches.jpg" alt="Inches">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Inches</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Thickness in [Imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units). 0.062".

# Metric

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Metric.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Metric.jpg" alt="Metric">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Metric</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

And here's the thickness in the correct system of units. 1.58mm.

# Smoothing the Walnut

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/SmoothWalnut.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/SmoothWalnut.jpg" alt="SmoothWalnut">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Smoothing the Walnut</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

To create the master laminate, I need to have all of the glue surfaces smooth. I once again use my smoothing plane to work on the walnut.

# Smoothing the Maple

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/SmoothStrips.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/SmoothStrips.jpg" alt="SmoothStrips">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Smoothing the Maple</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The maple strips are difficult to hold to be planed, so instead I sand them against a flat surface. I use one of the walnut pieces here to make sure that the maple is being pressed flatly against the sandpaper.

# Stack

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Stack.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Stack.jpg" alt="Stack">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Stack</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Here's the stack that I will laminate. That piece on top is going to be what holds the ring bits in the lathe. It will make more sense later.

# Glue

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Glue.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Glue.jpg" alt="Glue">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Glue</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Glued.

The astute reader may notice that we have 6 layers here instead of 4. The 2 outer layers are used to spread out the clamp pressure. These are usually called [Cauls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batten)

# Glued

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Glued.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Glued.jpg" alt="Glued">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Glued</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I left the glue overnight to dry, because I don't want anything to explode on the lathe (spoiler: this happens anyway!).

The squeeze out means that I had a nice even application of glue across the laminations. That's exactly what I want.

# Trim

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/TrimGlue.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/TrimGlue.jpg" alt="TrimGlue">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Trim the edges</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I want a piece with 3 parallel edges, and as many right angles as it can have in the reality we live in.

Once again the smoother plane comes out to do the job. I eyeball the faces to see if they are at right angles. I could use a square to do this, but I find that my eyes are accurate enough most of the time. I only bring out the square if I'm using the faces for some sort of joinery.

# The endgrain

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/True.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/True.jpg" alt="True">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Trim the end grain</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I love my [Veritas Shooting Plane](http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=70926&cat=1,230,41182,48945). End grain is notoriously difficult to plane since you're going at the fibers perpendicularly.

The plane is set on a device called a shooting board, which holds the plane at the correct angles, and then the plane is moved towards the shooting board's fence while the workpiece is pushed in to the plane.

The result is better than what you can get from any other tool.

Does it matter for this? Nope. It's fun though!

# Create the workblock

</a>
<div class="image-caption">Cut out the workblock</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I only need a small square piece to work with. I set the bandsaw to the smallest dimension of our laminations, then cut off a square.

# Shavings

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Shavings.jpg">

<div class="image-caption">Shavings</div>

Cool shavings!

</a>
<div class="image-caption">Shaving</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Here you can see how effective the glue is in the shaving. That thin strip of maple and the walnut look like a single piece of wood.

That shaving is 0.002"/0.05mm thick, and it holds together great.

# Chucked

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Chucked.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Chucked.jpg" alt="Chucked">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Chucked</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Throw our work in the [Lathe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathe).

# Oops.

{::nomarkdown}

<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/CatchAndRound.jpg" alt="CatchAndRound">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Evidence of an accident</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Obviously I need to round the square, but not so obviously I also apparently needed to have the work come flying off the lathe and smack me in the face.

You can see where the wood was ripped out of the chuck when a catch occurred.

# Size

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Size.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Size.jpg" alt="Size">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Size</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

My wife's ring size is just under 5/8"/1.6mm. I don't have any fancy bits that are here exact size, so I put a [5/8" forstner bit](http://www.rockler.com/how-to/the-value-of-forstner-bits/) in my tailstock and lightly press it in.

Note that the bit doesn't move. I am pressing the bit in to the spinning workpiece. It works exactly the same as if the bit was spinning. Referential movement and all that jazz.

# Hollowed

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Hollowed.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Hollowed.jpg" alt="Hollowed">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Hollowed</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I hollow out the piece just under the size I need by using the mark. This is slow work, and I used a 6mm [bench chisel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chisel) for the job. That isn't the correct tool to use, but it's what I have on hand.

The job was done without any accidents.

# Cut

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Cut.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Cut.jpg" alt="Cut">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Cut</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The ring is looking like a ring! I cut it off with a saw.

# Mandril

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Mandril.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Mandril.jpg" alt="Mandril">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Mandril</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

To work on the ring I need a way to hold it. I take a piece of hard maple and turn it to just over the diameter of the inside of the ring blank. Then I taper it very slightly.

The result is a [mandril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrel). I can press the ring on to it and it holds firmly. This is nothing more than a round wedge.

# Shaped

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Shaped.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Shaped.jpg" alt="Shaped">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Shaped</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The ring is shaped then sanded.

There's nothing complex about this. I hack at it with steel until it looks how I want, then I use increasing grits of sandpaper to fine tune it. It's not about skill, it's about patience and constant evaluation.

# Wax

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Wax.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Wax.jpg" alt="Wax">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Wax</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Now I need to wax my mandril. This may seem counter-intuitive since we want the ring to 'stick' to the mandril.

The ring will still hold fine, but if we ever want to get it off again, then we need to make it so glue doesn't stick to the mandril.

Why glue?!...

# Finish

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Finish.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Finish.jpg" alt="Finish">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Finish</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I apply [cyanoacrylate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate) (super glue) to the ring. This is a special type of glue that is very thin and watery.

The lathe is set to its slowest speed (or hand turned). I then put a small amount of CA on a paper towel and press it to the ring. This is repeated about 15 times. I use a CA Aerosol Activator between coats. That instantly dries the CA so I don't have to wait 15+ minutes for each coat.

You can also see why we needed to wax the mandril. The CA won't stick to the wax, so we avoid accidentally gluing the ring to the mandril and ruining everything.

# Polish

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Polish.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Polish.jpg" alt="Polish">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Polish</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The next step is to polish the finish. I like [Meguiar's Ultimate Compound](http://www.meguiars.com/en/automotive/products/g17216-ultimate-compound/) and [Meguiar's Ultimate Polish](http://www.meguiars.com/en/automotive/products/g19216-ultimate-polish/) for the task.

# Polished

The result of the polish. Glassy shiny.

</a>
<div class="image-caption">Applying compound</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I polish the same way that I apply the CA finish. I apply some of the liquid to a paper towel...

# How I polish pt. 2

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Polishing2.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Polishing2.jpg" alt="Polishing2">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Polishing for real</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Then I rub the polish against the work. It takes about 1 minute to bring it to a very bright shine.

If you [applied the CA](#finish) in many thin coats, then you can go straight to the compounding and polishing stages. If you have any big globs then you need to sand down and repeat. Many thin coats is the key here!

# Inside

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/Ring/Inside.jpg">
<img src="/assets/Ring/Thumbnails/Inside.jpg" alt="Inside">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Inside</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The outside of the ring is done, but it needs to be comfortable to wear too. I apply some masking tape to the outside so that the chuck jaws don't damage the finish.

I repeat the sanding, finishing and polishing.

**Note** I actually totally screwed up in this step. I dripped some CA and it got on the outer finish. I had to put it back on the [mandril](#mandril) and sand everything down, then refinish and repolish. I didn't capture these steps because I already did.

Accidents like this happen. There's no reason to get frustrated. That's effort that can be used to work forward on the project and find solutions. Evaluate your situation and take a break if you start to feel negative emotions build. This time I wasn't bothered by it and just threw the mandril on and was done in ~10 minutes.

# Ring

<a href="/assets/Ring/Ring.jpg">

That's the ring.

My wife is at work as I write this, so I don't know how she'll like it yet. I may update this post with a picture of it on her finger or a confused look.

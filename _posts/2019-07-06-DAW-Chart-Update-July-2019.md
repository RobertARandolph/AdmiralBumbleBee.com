I've update the [DAW Chart](/DAW-Chart.html)! I know, you're excited.

Here's the features of this update:

* FLStudio 20.5
* Logic 10.4.5
* Reason 10.4
* Mixbus 5.2
* [SAWStudio](http://www.rmllabs.com/MainSite/sawstudio.html) removed - I will not be purchasing the SAWStudio64 update, so it would be perpetually out of date from this time forward. (Also, I [hate windows]({% post_url 2018-12-15-Why-I-hate-Windows %}))
* **NEW** Excluded sections - These sections _only_ count if you manually weight them. They do not show in the "Combined Totals". This allows me to have highly subjective ratings that are 'opt-in only' for total ratings.
* **NEW** Menu category
* **NEW** Window Management category
* **NEW** Subjective Section
  * **NEW** Weirdness Category - how far does the DAW deviate from the norm?
  * **NEW** Comprehensibility Category - how difficult is it to become an 'advanced' user of a product?
  * **NEW** Fragility Category - how do a product's updates (or lack of) impede your workflow?
  * **NEW** Professionalism Category - how well does the product cater to 'professional' (money-making) workflows orthogonal to music-making
  * **NEW** Simplicity Category - This is **NOT EASE OF USE**. Simplicity is related to comprehensibility. It's ease of _understanding_ as opposed to _ease of use_. Unlike comprehensibility, this is how little knowledge is necessary to comprehend the primary workflows of the software.
* **NEW** Bias Category - Like anyone, I have a bias to/for a given product. I have done my best to convey how I feel that I'm biased on a scale of 0-10. Weighted only.
  * **NEW** Preference - My personal preference for the products.
  * **NEW** History - How long I've been using the product relative to its total existence.
  * **NEW** Connections - My personal connections to people, testing and my own dependence on the product.

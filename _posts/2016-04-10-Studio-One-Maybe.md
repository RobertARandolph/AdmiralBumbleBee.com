![Perhaps?](assets/Studio One/S1.jpg)

So I thought I'd try [Studio One](http://studioone.presonus.com/) for a month, instead of my normal, and beloved, [Digital Performer](http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp).

My issue is pretty big though. I immediately tried to setup a blank document to use for fiddling around, but renaming audio i/o in the Song Setup window crashes Studio One very reliably.

Well, that pretty much ruins it for me. 

Maybe they will fix it soon, then I'll look again.

Perhaps you remember [my previous post about Sonimus's fantastic customer interaction]({% post_url 2017-11-24-A-tale-of-amazing-customer-interaction %}). Well recently, on the same subject even, another company has stepped up: [TBProAudio](http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/index.html).

On the 5th of December [ISOL8 was released by TBProAudio](http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html). It was discussed on a few social services I use, and a number of people commented about the [perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)) render.

So I e-mailed TBProAudio.


> Hello. I was just made aware of your new free product http://tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html

> I know it is not in good taste to complain about a free product, but I thought I should drop you a note. I run a music chat server with 4000+ active users (discord.gg/edmp) and some folks were > recently talking about isol8. A number of users immediately complained that the GUI made them feel nauseous or seasick.

They changed the rendering mode from perspective to an orthographic render and many users were very happy.

TBProAudio responded in about 9 hours with:

# Fast resolution!

Today, the 11th of December, I received an e-mail from TBProAudio


> Hello Robert,
>
> OK, we got the message :-)  We just release V1.0.1 and changed GUI to orthographic rendering.
> Just to let you know...

**AWESOME!**. It's quite the rarity for developers to respond to changes in GUI based on feedback, especially so quickly. [ISOL8](http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/ISOL8.html) now has a [orthographic render](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection).

I've not spend much time using [TBProAudio](http://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/index.html) products, however I sure will give them all a shot now!

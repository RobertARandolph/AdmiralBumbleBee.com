Nothing fancy here, but [I've setup a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/AdmiralBumbleBee) since I've been asked about it so many times.

I'll be keeping the Patreon page up-to-date and pursuing this idea. Nothing else on the site will change, except possibly more content when Patreon goals are met.

[The paypal donation](/DonateNow/) is still live as well. You can just click the DONATE! link in the upper right to get both options.

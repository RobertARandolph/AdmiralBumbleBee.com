Time for some site updates!

I wanted to add more "Site Features" (static pages that are constantly updated) and I was running out of room in the nav. I also frequently receive complaints about how textually busy the site update is. I've aimed to improve both of these problems with this update.

* **Removed Google Analytics**
* Site Nav - I found the site nav difficult to use.
  * Increased size of elements
  * Increased size of header
  * Removed busy recent/tag sidebars(!) - It is an extra click, but I've never felt that they present the information well.
  * Added simple left-nav
    * It sucked when I made it.
    * Wife helped me make it not suck.
  * Move tags year/type widget
* Post Layout
  * Adjusted header spacings.
  * Allowed header to gracefully fail on different viewport sizes
  * Remove section hierarchy in posts
  * Add dynamic breadcrumbs
* Cleanup
  * Fixed a number of tags
  * Fixed all sorts of weird stuff I missed
    * My wife found them, thank you.
* New feature!
  * [Health](/Health.html) - I get a few e-mails a week about my health, so I thought I'd put up a full page about it. My hope is that this disclosure will help other people with similar problems navigate their options and know they are not alone.
* Updated [About page](/about/)

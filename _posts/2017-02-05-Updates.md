Firstly, I've added a Donate Button in the menu bar, and at the bottom of every new post. Some of these posts take me a lot of time, and I will also be relaying how much time it took me to create the post.

On another topic, I have a thing I do called my "Monthly Challenge". Once a month I purposely challenge myself to something new. It may be creating a new habit, changing a habit, trying new software etc... I've written about some of these in my DAW posts, but I will be trying to post about all of them on my blog now.

This month I've decided to stop using [VIM](http://www.vim.org) for text editing. I've decided to try the following editors in its place: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), [Atom](https://atom.io), [TextMate](https://macromates.com), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Brackets](http://brackets.io).

I will tell you that off the bat, I absolutely __LOVE__ [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com). I've written the last 2 components for this site and the last 2 posts with it. I've done a small C project and a few python scripts as well. It's _FANTASTIC_. I may not even try the other editors! (Well that's a lie. I triet Atom first, and it was slow as molasses, so I won't be going back to that.)

There might be a hint as to what I'm working on now in this post. It shouldn't be difficult to spot :) It's _A LOT_ of work though, so give me a day or two to finish up.

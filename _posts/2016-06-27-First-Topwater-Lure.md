I've never made any sort of [topwater fishing lure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topwater_fishing_lure), so I figured I'd just turn and carve a simple [popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_popper).

The wood is [Kauri](http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/softwoods/kauri/) for the inside strip and [Padauk](http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/african-padauk/) on the sides. Some sparkles applied then 5 coats of polyurethane.

Eyelets are inset with epoxy.

My wife broke the ice cream scoop. It's not a fancy one, but it's the one we have.

So what's my job? My job is to fix it of course... after being reminded about a dozen times. It's basically 'Husband Energy'. Each reminder slowly builds up sufficient energy so that I can complete the task, but the task can not be completed until that energy is sufficiently in store.

It's go time!

Here it is. A cheap ice cream scoop. The edges around the tang fell apart when being used to leverage out the Ice Cream.

# Rough

{:/nomarkdown}

I started with a [piece of swamp ash](http://www.wood-database.com/swamp-ash/). It's boring, but I'm going to make it less boring.


# Trim

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Trim.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Trim.jpg" alt="Trim">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Trim</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

First I trim it down to size. About 5" x 2.5" or 12.7cm x 6.35cm.

My hand really isn't that close to the blade, and there's no forces involved here that would put me in danger given even a catastrophic failure.

If this was a tablesaw I would **never** do anything similar. I'd use a miter gauge and no fence. Bandsaws and Tablesaws are totally different things in action and both have their own set of safety precautions.

# Push

<a href="/assets/IceCream/Push.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Push.jpg" alt="Push">

<div class="image-caption">Push</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I use a push-stick when I need to work close.

# Mark the Center

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/MarkCenter.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/MarkCenter.jpg" alt="MarkCenter">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Mark the Center</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Now I need to find the center so I can split this...

I use [a center finder](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Larson-800-2875-Plastic-Center/dp/B000CD1T0A), which isn't at all necessary. You can mark from corner to corner, but this is far easier since the corner is caught by the tool.

# Center

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Center.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Center.jpg" alt="Center">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Center</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

That's the center.

I hope you enjoyed that image as much as I did.

# Split

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Split.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Split.jpg" alt="Split">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Split</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The blank is split down the center.

# Marriage

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Marriage.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Marriage.jpg" alt="Marriage">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Marriage</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I place a triangular mark so that I can glue these pieces back together in the same orientation.

If you think that looks nice, you should see my handwriting!

# Flatten

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Flatten.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Flatten.jpg" alt="Flatten">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Flatten</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Now I flatten all 4 sides. I should have done this _before_ splitting it, but uh... oops. I just lined them up by hand and planed them down.

# Square

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Square.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Square.jpg" alt="Square">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Square</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Now I square the ends with my [Veritas shooting plane](http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/Page.aspx?p=70926&cat=1,230,41182,48945)

# Center the scoop tang

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/CenterScoop.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/CenterScoop.jpg" alt="CenterScoop">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Centering the scoop tang</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I need to mark out the portion for the scoop tang mortise. I use a [Veritas marking gauge](http://www.leevalley.com/US/wood/page.aspx?p=59455) and some trial and error.

I place the tang on the wood and adjust the gauge until it fits both sides. Now it's centered.

# Mark the tang mortise

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/MarkTang.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/MarkTang.jpg" alt="MarkTang">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Mark the tang mortise</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I cut the tang mortise marks with the marking gauge. The end is marked to be longer than the tang in case there's extra glue later. I don't want to be unable to push it all the way in because some glue is turning my mortise in to a hydraulic piston.

# Mark the mortise depth

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/MarkDepth.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/MarkDepth.jpg" alt="MarkDepth">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">MarkDepth</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I use a [Veritas small router plane](http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=57677&cat=1,41182,57677) to set the depth of the mortise. This is also what I cut it with.

# Prep the mortise

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/PrepMortise.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/PrepMortise.jpg" alt="PrepMortise">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Prep the mortise</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I use a chisel to prepare the edges as shown. Then I use the router plane to route out the center.

# Glue

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Glue.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Glue.jpg" alt="Glue">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Glue</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The two sides are glued up with some [Titebond Original](http://www.titebond.com/product.aspx?id=d4d28015-603f-4dfc-a7d9-f684acc71207)

You may notice that the end of the mortise is slightly sloped. I added that as extra insurance against hydraulic lock.

# Clamp

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Clamp.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Clamp.jpg" alt="Clamp">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Clamp</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Clamped. On the side with the mortise I added 2 extra clamps on each side. I really want that to be tight.

Clamped up.

# Glued

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Glued.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Glued.jpg" alt="Glued">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Glued</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Glued.

# TrimEdges

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/TrimEdges.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/TrimEdges.jpg" alt="TrimEdges">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">TrimEdges</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

It's slightly too large, so I just trim it. Each side is trimmed equally so that the mortise stays centered.

# Turn

{:/nomarkdown}

Above is a time lapse video of turning the basic handle shape.

Let's play a fun game called, "Spot when Robert injures himself." 

No matter who wins, I lose.

# Copper

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Copper.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Copper.jpg" alt="Copper">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Copper</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

For the ferrule I use a 3/4" or 2cm piece of copper pipe.

# Ferrule

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Ferrule.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Ferrule.jpg" alt="Ferrule">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Ferrule</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

It's cut down to about 5/8" or 1.5cm.

# Ferruled

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Ferruled.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Ferruled.jpg" alt="Ferruled">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Ferruled</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

The ferrule is temporarily in place here. This stops the wood from expanding when I put the tang in.

Without the ferrule, the tang could push the wood apart and then there's nothing left to hold it in.

# Ferrule Glue

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/FerruleGlue.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/FerruleGlue.jpg" alt="FerruleGlue">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Ferrule Glued</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I use thick [Cyanoacrylate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate) from [Rabid Models](http://stores.ebay.com/RabidModels).

# Ferrule Shine

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/FerruleShine.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/FerruleShine.jpg" alt="FerruleShine">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Ferrule Shine</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Just a quick sanding of the ferrule.

# Char

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Char.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Char.jpg" alt="Char">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Char</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Here's the fun part! I turn on the lathe and inside a veritable bomb (sawdust + fire = death)... I char the ash.

Then I sand it.

Then I char it.

Then I sand it.

Then... I keep doing that until I like it.

The idea is that I want the low spots in the wood to retain the char, and the high spots to have a lighter look to them. That will showcase the gain even more.

# Sanded

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Sanded.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Sanded.jpg" alt="Sanded">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Sanded</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Sanded until I'm happy with it.

# Pores

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Pores.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Pores.jpg" alt="Pores">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Pores</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

A neat look at the pores in the wood and how the charring works.

# Tung Oil

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/TungOil.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/TungOil.jpg" alt="TungOil">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Tung Oil</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I apply [Pure Tung Oil](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/woodriver-pure-tung-oil-quart) to the wood. **NOT** Tung oil finish. They are totally different things. 'Tung Oil Finish' usually doesn't even have tung oil in it!

# Drying Oil

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/DryingOil.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/DryingOil.jpg" alt="DryingOil">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Drying Oil</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Pure tung oil dries very slowly. It can be accelerated with heat, so I do that.

# Handle

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Handle.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Handle.jpg" alt="Handle">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Handle</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

That's the handle. I shined the ferrule a bit extra with some [7448 Scotchbrite](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/Scotch-Brite-Hand-Pad-7448/?N=5002385+3293241243&rt=rud). It leaves a very nice finish.

I also applied a light oil to it to help prevent corrosion. Over time the copper will patina and become brown with some green to it.

I would appreciate no comments about other potential uses for this device. It's an ice cream scoop handle. Thanks.

# Epoxy

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Epoxy.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Epoxy.jpg" alt="Epoxy">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Epoxy</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I use some epoxy to secure the tang in the handle.

This was quite the harrowing experience. I nearly didn't get it in. I had to make little wood blocks so I could carefully hammer the scoop in without bending the metal or marring anything.

I barely made it.

# Finished

{::nomarkdown}
<a href="/assets/IceCream/Finished.jpg">
<img src="/assets/IceCream/Thumbnails/Finished.jpg" alt="Finished">
</a>
<div class="image-caption">Finished</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Look at that! It's done...

I hate how it looks. It's less dark in person, but I'm not a fan of that hipstery 'vintage barnyard' look.

It's done and it works though.

However, I am tempted to try and sharpen it and add a heating element...

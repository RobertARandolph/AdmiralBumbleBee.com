Do you have a drill press with a table? Does it have an insert? It's square isn't it?

Don't be a square! Round drill press inserts allow you to have way more life out of your insert. A bonus is that you can always drill in to the same sized hole by turning the insert to the appropriate place.

If you are careful, one insert can last you a lifetime.

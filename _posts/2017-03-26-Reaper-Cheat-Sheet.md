[![Reaper Cheat Sheet](/assets/Reaper/ReaperCheat.jpg)](/assets/Reaper/ReaperCheat.pdf)

So I'm doing the 1 month of Reaper thing again. I created myself this 2 page trifold cheat sheet for macOS shortcuts. I suggest printing it out 2-sided if you can, and do it on nice paper.

If it helps you out, please let me know in the comments! This is purely default settings. If there is something that you would like added, let me know!

I will be doing a more extensive write-up on my experience, and update the DAW chart soon.

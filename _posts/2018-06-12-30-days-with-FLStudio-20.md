It's that time!

[FLStudio 20](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/?) is out and it's time for me to take it to task.

This review will most likely take more than 30 days, because I'll also be covering [every single Image Line product](https://www.image-line.com/plugins/category/all/) as well.

I am reviewing an NFR copy of the entire [Image Line](https://www.image-line.com) suite of software. I did not pay for the products in this review, however I'm not going to tone down my review in any way. If you feel that I am then please call me out on it.

I may be throwing in a fun twist to the format this time as well ;) See you again in 3-4 days!

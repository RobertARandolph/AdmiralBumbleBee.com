[![Cheap Adapter](/assets/DrumStuff/Thumbnails/CheapAdapter.jpg)](/assets/DrumStuff/CheapAdapter.jpg)

Why pay upwards of $50 for a mic adapter for a tom?

Made in less than 5 minutes with 2 bolts, a wingnut, some scrap pine and a 1/4-20 to 5/8-27 adapter made out of Jatoba. I may cover making the adapters in another post some day.

I have a [Pyle PDMIC78](https://www.amazon.com/Pyle-Pro-PDMIC78-Professional-Handheld-Microphone/dp/B005BSOVRY) on there which I purchased for under $10. Surprisingly it works just fine. I figured I'd give it a shot on toms and so far I think I can recommend it for that task.

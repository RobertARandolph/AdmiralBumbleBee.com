description: Big backend updates
---

I've made some fairly major backend updates to the website. **MUCH BETTER** mobile experience, more responsive site layout, improved side bars (which I'll make use of later), better text formatting and more.

I've also updated the DAW chart with a few new categories and much better formatting.

I've removed the experimental 'Mixing Services' service as well. The intent was to provide lower-cost mixing services to musicians that may benefit from less thorough mixing services. The result was me doing **far** more work for much less money. It was an interesting experiment while it lasted, but I'm back to my previous rates. E-mail me (as usual) at audiolabs via gmail for any information.

Please let me know if anything is broken in the comments, thank you!

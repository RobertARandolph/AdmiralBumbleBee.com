I got some cheap old hardware store plane from my Uncle, and I decided to to a partial restore and conversion to a scrub plane.

# Starting

Pretty nasty condition to start. It was sitting in a bucket with water and other rusted tools.

# Sandblast

Then I take it apart and blast it with #70 Aluminum Oxide with my new sandblasting cabinet.

# Paint it

I forget to take pictures post paint. Here's some prepping.

I painted it with [Rustoleum Gloss Specialty Lacquer](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Rust-Oleum-Specialty-11-oz-Gloss-Black-Lacquer-Spray-Paint-1905830/100195918). I'm quite happy with this product for this purpose, and it looks fantastic!

You can also spot my beloved [Olfa AK-4 Art Knife](http://www.amazon.com/OLFA-Cushion-Grip-Art-Knife/dp/B0006O87TQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460223599&sr=8-1&keywords=olfa+hobby+knife). Check out my very long review on Amazon there.

# Done

After paint, all there was to do was a good scrubbing with various abrasives to make it look pretty-ish, adding a curve to the blade, and sharpening.

The tote and knob were finished with a 1:1 polyurethane:linseed oil mixture that has red, brown and black transtint dyes. I wish I had before images. This is a huge improvement over the gunked up and disgusting mass I started with!

It works quite well and now I can hog off some material much quicker!

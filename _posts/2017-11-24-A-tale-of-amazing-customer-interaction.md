Recently [Sonimus released StonEQ 4K](http://sonimus.com/products/StonEQ4k/) which is an [SSL 4k series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_State_Logic#4000_series) EQ emulation.

**I bought it.**

If you read [my most recent post about what I want in an EQ]({% post_url 2017-11-21-What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ %}), you might be confused. Why did I purchase an EQ that has only [what I do not want]({% post_url 2017-11-21-What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ %}#what-i-do-not-want) and none of the [features that I do want]({% post_url 2017-11-21-What-do-I-want-in-an-EQ %}#what-i-want)?

# The start

**WARNING! THIS MAY MAKE YOU SICK TO YOUR STOMACH!**

Does this make you nauseous? It make me nauseous. The GUI is rendered as a [perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)).

No matter which direction, or which lighting you look at this image at, your brain is tricked. If you stare at the image, like many of us do, for a period of time then look away you may suddenly feel dizzy or nauseous because of the perspective cues that don't make sense.

I'm not looking "down" at my computer screen. I don't have lights in the upper right. I don't get _that close_ to an EQ when I use it. Worst of all, the perspective doesn't change when you move positions.

This isn't an uncommon thing. A number of developers use perspective rendering. People like me have issues with it though.

Recently sonimus released this product and they [were met with a lot of criticism about this rendering](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/new-product-alert/1187003-sonimus-releases-stoneq-4k-satson-series-equalizer.html).

The timeline...

* _Within 1 week of the initial criticism_ Diego at sonimus [posts 3 new options](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12953336-post43.html)
    * Everyone prefers C, but it's still not right.
* Diego posts 2 [new options](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12953403-post50.html)
    * Everyone prefers D, but it's _still_ not right.
* RMorgan chimes in and [mentions using a simple](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12953742-post60.html) [orthographic render](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection)
* Diego [offers an orthographic projection](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12956298-post85.html)
    * Universally liked!
* Within 2 weeks of the original launch [the new GUI is public](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/12972178-post137.html)

While the new GUI still has some visual cues that are practically nonsensical, they are at least consistent. This resolves the seasickness issue for me.

# Conclusion

[Sonimus](http://sonimus.com/products/) responded to criticism in the best possible way. They took time to understand the people with an issue, offered options, _took more time to understand the response to those options_!, and responded further.

The ultimate result being that they have earned themselves a fan.

And you know what? [StonEQ 4k](http://sonimus.com/products/StonEQ4k/) is pretty damn good.

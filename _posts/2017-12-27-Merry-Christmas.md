I'm taking a short break (~5-7 days) for this holiday season. I'm not counting these next few days as part of my [30 days with Logic Pro X]({% post_url 2017-12-14-30-days-of-Apple-Logic-Pro-X %}) so don't worry, you're not getting ripped off!

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone!

Meanwhile, check out some of the gifts I received for Christmas!

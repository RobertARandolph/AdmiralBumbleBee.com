description: These are a few of my favorite things.
---

I get a lot of e-mails and messages asking me "What's your favourite...". I don't think anyone should really care, but my wife has been pushing me to put together a page about it for years now. I have capitulated.

So now in the features section you can go to the "[Favourites](/Favourites.html)" page

# Favourites

I average a couple dozen "What's your favourite..." or "What do you use for..." a week. Sometimes I get a few dozen _per day_. This ranges from studio equipment, to health products, to woodworking, to electronics equipment, to clothing (seriously, I don't understand.) and more.

My wife has been urging me to do this _and_ to use affiliate links. Affiliate links being links that take you to a site with a special code and I get some kickback for it. **I won't be doing this**.

Everything that can be reasonably linked is linked with bare links. I get nothing from you looking at the items. If you want to support the site than you can [subscribe on Patreon](http://patreon.com/admiralbumblebee) or [donate directly](https://paypal.me/admiralbumblebee).

I will be trying to keep the list up to date if/when these things changes.

[I would also like if you read the header on the favourites page](/Favourites.html#what-this-is).

A simple open mortise and tenon joint that's been planed smooth by a 25Â° included angle blade in a [Veritas Low-Angle Jack Plane](http://www.leevalley.com/US/Wood/page.aspx?p=49708&cat=1,41182,52515). The wood is [Hard Maple](http://www.wood-database.com/hard-maple/) and the glue is [Elmer's Wood Glue Max](http://elmers.com/product/detail/e7300)(A product which I really like).

First what _you_ see...

Then what a Canon T3i with a reversed 18-35mm lens sees...

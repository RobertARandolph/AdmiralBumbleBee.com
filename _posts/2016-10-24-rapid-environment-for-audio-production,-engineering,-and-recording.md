Yep. Masochism. 1 month, as best I can stand it. Reports here and of course updates to the chart.

I still have ongoing projects in DP, which thankfully will stay there, but anything I can do in Reaper will be done in Reaper. Cthulhu, bless me on this journey for only you understand the feelings I'll bear.

The recent [Cubase post]({% post_url 2018-11-14-Cubase-10-update %}) took a lot out of me this week for content creation.

So I spend my effort doing a lot of backend improvement. Bugfixes on the site, improved nav-bar, youtube improvements and [DAW Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) is improved.

I made a new video for the DAW Chart for people that like videos. The DAW Chart also [has price information now](/DAW-Explain.html#price) and I fixed some ratings that were mildly errant.

**IF THE PAGE LOOKS WEIRD THEN DO THIS**:

* Safari - cmd-option-r
* Chrome - ctrl-F5 (Win) cmd-shift-r (Mac)
* Firefox - ctrl-F5 (Win) cmd-shift-r (Mac)

I also changed some colours to make the page feel nicer to read.

I did a live woodworking stream in my shop on youtube. Here it is!

I may do more of these or not. I'm just trying to get view-hours so I can monetize videos. If you'd like to just turn this on in the background and mute it, it'd help me out.

Or... you could watch it :)

(Yes, I chose that thumbnail on purpose. I think it's hilarious)

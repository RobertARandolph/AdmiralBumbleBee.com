First things first, the video is about my top 5 favorite plugins to use in 2018 (not what came out in 2018).

**THERE IS MORE THAN THE VIDEO!!**

[Up in the navbar there's a new feature](/FreeBees.html). I have compiled a list of all of the free (libre and/or gratis) software that I find to be worth downloading.

I've downloaded 100s of plugins and audio softwares, tried them, tested them and wrote notes about them. The result is a list of **FREE** (libre and/or gratis) plugins that are win64/mac64 and/or Linux capable.

There's no synthedit trash on the list. There isn't dozens upon dozens of win32 plugins that crash, annoy mac users, and make you wish your host had a plugin bridge.

I will be keeping this list up to date as much as I can in the future, and if you have suggestions please let me know. Read the FAQ first so you understand what will even be possible on the list.

P.S. I know I need to improve the navigation bar. It's on my mind. I'm not sure what I want to do yet, but it will get done when I figure out a style that I like.

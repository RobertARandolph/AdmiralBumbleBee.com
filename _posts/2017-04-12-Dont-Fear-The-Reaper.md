I'm 20 days in to my 30 days with [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm).

In the last 5 days, my time spent in each DAW as a percentage, according to [Time Sink](https://manytricks.com/timesink/) has been:

* Reaper - 99%
* DP - 1%
 
 
I am actually getting along with Reaper very nicely now. It's not required much customization, but a lot of learning about what _can be done_. In this post I'm going to go over some of the things that I've changed that really improved the experience for me.

# Extensions

## HeDa Track Inspector VIP (under cursor)

I feel like [HeDa Track Inspector VIP](https://reaper.hector-corcin.com/app/track-templates) is an absolute must have. It's a fantastic way to work when you don't want a mixer open.

I currently have a [custom action](#custom-actions) setup so if I hover over a track, I can press the 'Q' key to pop-up a Heda Track Inspector. See the gif for an example.

## HeDa Loudness Graph VIP

Yet another extremely useful script from HeDa. The [Loudness Graph VIP](https://reaper.hector-corcin.com/app/loudness-graph) displays a ridiculous amount of useful information in an easy to see graph format.

Really fantastic tool.

## Radial Menus

I had planned to show my monsterous Radial Menus setup, but the active and friendly developer [helped me out with some ideas](http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=186637) to improve my current setup.

Radial menus can open a different menu based on context, it supports swiping (with various settings), colouring options, shortcut to specific menus and more.

I know that radial menus aren't a new thing, but this is one of the nicest implementations that I've seen in any software, let alone in a DAW!.

# Screensets

  <div class="image-caption">Screensets</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

I have setup 3 screensets. That's it. F4, F5 and F6. Edit, Mix, Midi.

I have various windows open (track manager, performance, undo window, fx, etc..) depending on what I'm doing. Screensets (or the analog) aren't anything fancy, but in Reaper it's _really_ a key to getting your environment setup how you want it. In most other DAWs you can get by without ever touching that feature, but I don't think that's possible in Reaper unless you A. like clutter or B. have very simple uses.

I'm certain that as I continue using Reaper over the next 10 (or more?) days, I will have at least 3 more screensets setup, but I'm still experimenting. As a [SAWStudio](http://sawstudio.com) user, I had 20 that I used very frequently. I have 12 in [Digital Performer](http://motu.com/products/software/dp) that are used constantly.

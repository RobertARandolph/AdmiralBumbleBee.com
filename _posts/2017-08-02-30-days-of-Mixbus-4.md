Next up on the 30 day list is [Mixbus 32c 4.1](http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus32c.html). This time I will _not_ be using it for all my work, but instead trying to shoe it in as often as possible. I guarantee at least 100 hours spent in it by the end of this review however.

Mixbus is actually a rather unique product with a number of interesting features. A number of reviews across the internet have already explored Mixbus as a 'mixing software', but I will be considering Mixbus as an entire package.

**Is Mixbus a good standalone DAW?** That is the context of the review.

I will also be reviewing the [Mixbus Plug-ins](http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus-plugin
s.html) during the effects review.

Let's see how well this upstart product compares to many of the more popular products on the market!

**UPDATE**: Please see the new [**DAW Feature Chart**](/DAW-Chart.html) for more up-to-date information and a way cooler chart.

As you may know, I've spent [a lot of time]({% post_url 2017-03-30-Things-that-I-really-like-about-Reaper %}) in [Reaper]({% post_url 2017-04-04-Things-that-I-really-dislike-about-Reaper %}) lately.

My time spent in each DAW as a percentage, according to [Time Sink](https://manytricks.com/timesink/) has been:

* Reaper - 91%
* Studio One - 3%
* DP - 5%
* Renoise - 2% 
 
There may be a bit of a rounding error there ;) Again... Let's discuss how things have gone some more though...

<!--more-->

[I've found _A LOT_ of things in Reaper that I like.]({% post_url 2017-03-30-Things-that-I-really-like-about-Reaper %}) [It's been an incredibly frustrating experience to get started though.]({% post_url 2017-04-04-Things-that-I-really-dislike-about-Reaper %}). Overall, the more I figure out about Reaper, the more I like it. It's really a feature-packed program with a fantastic community.

At this point, I actually see almost nothing about Reaper that would prevent me from using it actively. It does everything that I need, handles the projects I do in an excellent manner, and I've found workflows that I never imagined existed. _It only took about ~75 hours of frustration and hair pulling to get there. Seriously._

Maybe you think I switch DAWs often, since I do spend a lot of my spare time learning and exploring products, but I have been fairly steadfast. Here's my progression of primary, and secondary DAWs over the years.


* ~1980s-2017 - Various Trackers. Largely [Fast Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastTracker_2) and [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com)
* ~1995-1998 - [N-track](http://en.ntrack.com/index.php) - No major work done with this, but it was the first DAW software I owned on my own PC. (as opposed to using at a school or studio)
* ~1997-2007 - [SAW->SAWStudio](http://sawstudio.com) - I _love_ this software. I really do, but it has not kept up with the times.
    * ~2002-2005 - [Tracktion](https://www.tracktion.com) - I used tracktion for personal projects for a period of time. It is/was a DAW that makes it easy to lay down sound with minimum cognitive overload.
    * ~2004-2006 - [Podium](https://zynewave.com) - As Tracktion became more complex, Podium stepped up and became the "Creative DAW" for me when I wanted to just fool around or make noise with friends. Podium could have been an real contender.
* ~2007-2010 - [Pro Tools HD](http://www.avid.com/pro-tools) - I refuse to purchase another AVID product, even though I really enjoy using Pro Tools for recording and editing.
    * 2008-2010 - [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) - I toured with a band (drums) using Live for backing tracks, click and effects.
* ~2010-??? - [Digital Performer](http://motu.com/products/software/dp) - This is basically the best overall product that I have used. Largely because the ability to navigate a project, edit very quickly and manage complex/massive projects is unparalleled. [It has its problems]({% post_url 2016-12-16-Things-I-hate-about-Digital-Performer %}), but the overall net experience is a gain for productivity and quality.
    * 2009-??? - [Studio One](http://www.presonus.com/products/Studio-One) - I have used Studio One as a secondary DAW for collaboration and drum editing.

Edit: I left out my non-audio use of a major DAW during that time. While doing sales for a certain companies product, I continued to use SAWStudio :)

So in about 20 years, I've used 3 (4 if you count Live being used live) products in a focused/professional capacity. At this point, I feel like I may make another switch unless something major comes down the pipeline for Digital Performer. I am constantly running in to that feeling of, "I know I can get this done faster in another product", that I started feeling in 2006 with SawStudio. No matter how much I enjoy using the software, the goal is productivity and quality of output.

So anyway here's the updated DAW Comparison chart after 2 weeks of using Reaper.

My my, how things have changed. 75% of the things that made me improve Reaper's rating  have been added since I first wrote my notes down. 25% of the rating increase is just me torturing myself and learning how Reaper works.

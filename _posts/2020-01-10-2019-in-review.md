I wanted to take some time to discuss what I did on this website in 2019, talk about donations/contributions and discuss what I spend donation/patreon money on.

Plus some goals and ideas, I suppose.

Let's get to it.

## Patreon

(Output from Patreon reports csv->sheets)

In 2019 I received $1,535.29 from Patreon in 2019, with a total gross of $1,692.72.

$72.74 in processing fees, and $84.69 to patreon.

## Direct Donations

(Output from Paypal transaction reports, filtered lines not containing "Donation". csv->sheets)

I received $1095.99 from paypal after fees. $1,155.50 in gross was sent, and $59.51 in fees were taken out.

## Gross Stuff

### Ads

Estimated Monthly **POTENTIAL** earnings from 2 ads per page: $1,204-$3,500 (based on a variety of estimators and my current site stats). Yearly estimate: $14,448.00-42,000

**ACTUAL AD REVENUE**: $0.00


### Placement opportunities

Total Offered Placement Opportunities: $5,700.00 (direct payment or product)

**ACTUAL PLACEMENT REVENUE**: $0.00

### Total Opportunity lost

Total Ad/Placement Opportunity Value Turned Down: ~$20,148.00 (low estimate)

**I HATE ADS**. I will never put them on my website. No affiliate links. No sponsored placement. I will always note if a product was acquired without normal payment, and I _always purchase_ products that I decide to continue using after a review.

## Totals

$2,848.22 in total donations.

$216.94 in fees.

*Earnings after fees*: $2,631.28

# Spending

## Support

I supported the following entities with monthly or one-time donations (I will not disclose the amounts, sorry). Many of these donations I make anonymously.

* [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
* [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva)
* [Nim](https://nim-lang.org)
* [Abo-Abo](https://github.com/abo-abo) - One of my favorite developers. My life revolves around his emacs packages, almost literally.
* [Ardour](https://ardour.org)
* [Child's Play](http://childsplaycharity.org)
* [Charity Music](http://www.charitymusic.org)
* [Rich Hickey](https://github.com/richhickey)
* [ReaperBlog](https://reaperblog.net)
* [Settings Sync](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync) - I used this for 6 months and I'll forever be trying to make emacs device syncing work with such simplicity.

*Total Spent* - Pfft. As if I'm going to disclose charitable/support giving. The actual total will not be disclosed in further calculations so that clever people can't figure out the value. I believe Rich Hickey and Cider are the only public contributions that I make.

Thank you!

## Food

I purchased $512.00 of food in 2019 that was eaten while working on content for this website.

(I round up my tips at dining establishments so that my running total is always even.)

## Net Totals

*Total Earned*: $2,631.28

*Total Spent*: $8,251.88

*Net Gain*: $-5,520.6

# Content

## Time spent

I opened [Dired Plus](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredPlus), marked files matching the regex `2019`, ran `grep <files> -nHoh --null -e '([0-9]*) hours'` on the marked files with `dired-do-grep` (bound to `C-M-g`) and then I manually removed eroneous results.

[I use Time Sink](https://manytricks.com/timesink/) to keep track of how much time I spend in specific software, and [I use OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) to schedule my time fairly strictly. My time estimates are accurate to within 30 minutes per article.

I spent 1,277 hours writing/researching/editing/etc... on articles for this website in 2019. I wrote 65 articles of some sort.

Average of 24.6 hours spent per week.

Average of 1.25 articles per week.

## Written

Marked files in [Dired Plus](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredPlus) containing 2019 in the file name. Ran shell command (`!`) `cat * | wc` with the options `-l` for lines, `-w` for words and `-m` for characters. This method does include some templating content, but I estimated (based on actual posts) that this accounts for <1% of characters counted.

I wrote 14,908 lines of text here in 2019.

131,985 words were written. (A "Novel" is generally 40,000 words).

894,889 characters. Average of 6.78 characters per word.

## Hourly Rate

Before spending, I made approximately $2.06 per hour writing for this website.

After spending, I **SPENT** ("lost") approximately $4.32 per hour writing for this website.

# 2020 Goals

Goals for 2020 -

* Write fewer articles - I felt that there was an occasional decline in quality in 2019 due to my [declining health]({% post_url 2019-09-06-More-Health %}), lack of ideas and my [growing discontentment with writing]({% post_url 2019-11-09-On-Content_Creation %}).
* Write higher quality articles - I would like to increase the depth that I go into in content. I also wish to improve the quality of included media.
* Improve Accessibility - More accessibility improvements!
* Re-vamp [The DAW Chart](/DAW-Chart.html) - I've had ideas of doing this with [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com) and switching to a dynamic system (rather than static system built locally and deployed).
  * New UI ideas?
* More programming and electronics articles tied in to music topics.
  * Fewer reviews.
* More woodworking projects related to music and computer use.
* Continue to improve mobile experience - I'll be working on this tomorrow.

# 2020 Ideas

* Music/Mixing Tutorials?
* New backend system? (finally finish my own site generator? maybe?)
* Review a Windows DAW?
* 30 days doing X... where X isn't a review.

I have about 30 specific article ideas written down. Maybe half are feasible. That list grows and shrinks with high frequency, so it could very well be 80 ideas in a week or 10 :)

# Conclusion

Thanks for reading! I hope this gave you some insight into the site and what your contributions help me do.

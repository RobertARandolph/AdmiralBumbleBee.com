The video version of the [Drum Dial Article]({% post_url 2019-10-12-The-problem-with-the-Drum-Dial  %}), with different presentation and some different information.

This is also my first time using [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) because [Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) constantly renders with glitches and does not handle audio devices properly. Quick the learning curve switching to FCPX, but I think this will improve the quality of my content as well.

![Yeah, all the time](/assets/StudioEvaluatione/crash.png)

I see this damn thing all the time. It wouldn't be a big deal except I've had Studio One crash _while saving_ and corrupt the save file. Not exactly professional behaviour, but it is exceptionally frustrating. At least it fits in with a lot of my other S1 experiences thusfar.

They are fixing issues relatively frequently, but so far this has been the most unstable DAW that I've used. I also get the feeling like I'm squeezed for performance with Studio One, but I have no concrete data yet.

I'm currently in OS X 10.11.5, with no such issues in other DAWs.

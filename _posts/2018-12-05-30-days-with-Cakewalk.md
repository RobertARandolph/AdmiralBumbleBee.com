This is a big one for me. [Cakewalk](https://cakewalk.bandlab.com) is a Windows only DAW. I **HATE** Windows (which I may explain why, in depth, later).

I'll be spending 30 days working with Cakewalk as much as possible and leaving my thoughts as usual.

**Other posts in this series**:

{% assign cakes = site.posts | where: "series", "Cakewalk" | sort: 'date' %}
<ul>
{% for my_page in cakes %} 
    {% if page.url != my_page.url and my_page.layout != "reader" %}
        <li><a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ my_page.title | split: '-' | last }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

# Nothing here.

This is just an announcement post. I need at least a week head-start. I spend a great deal of time ensuring my content is accurate and that my opinions are well-founded.

Sorry for the lack of content, but I don't want to just throw out half-assed things to meet my self-imposed weekly deadline.

# Support Me!

I spent ~25 hours working with Cakewalk this week, despite no content being produced for the site yet. If you appreciate the information presented then <a href="/DonateNow/">please consider joining patreon or paying me for my time spent bringing you quality content!</a>

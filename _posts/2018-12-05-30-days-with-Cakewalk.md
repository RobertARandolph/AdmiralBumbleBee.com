This is a big one for me. [Cakewalk](https://cakewalk.bandlab.com) is a Windows only DAW. I **HATE** Windows (which I may explain why, in depth, later).

I'll be spending 30 days working with Cakewalk as much as possible and leaving my thoughts as usual.

# Nothing here.

This is just an announcement post. I need at least a week head-start. I spend a great deal of time ensuring my content is accurate and that my opinions are well-founded.

Sorry for the lack of content, but I don't want to just throw out half-assed things to meet my self-imposed weekly deadline.

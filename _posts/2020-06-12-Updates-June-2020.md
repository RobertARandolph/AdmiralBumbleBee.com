This week I've done a number of updates to the DAW Chart.

* Updated the FAQ
    * I primarily use Cubase, Logic and Digital Performer. I haven't used REAPER seriously since V6 was released.
    * Note Ease of use section in "Why is Ableton Live rated so low?"
* [Ease of Use](/DAW-Explain.html#ease-of-use) - Added category and following sub-categories.
    * [UI Consistency](/DAW-Explain.html#ui-consistency)
    * [Immediacy](/DAW-Explain.html#immediacy)
    * [Out of the box Audio experience](/DAW-Explain.html#ootb-audio)
    * [Out of the box MIDI experience](/DAW-Explain.html#ootb-midi)
    * [Out of the box GUI experience](/DAW-Explain.html#ootb-gui)
    * [Out of the box general experience](/DAW-Explain.html#ootb-general)
    * [Out of the box hardware experience](/DAW-Explain.html#ootb-hardware)
* Software Defaults removed. Rolled into the above categories.
* FLStudio updated for:
    * Scripting +3 - New Feature added
    * Themability +1 - New Feature added
* Logic
    * Stability +1 - Zero crashes with Logic in 2020 despite approximately 400 hours of wide ranging use.
    * Step Sequencing +6 - New Feature added
    * Clip Launching +7 - New Feature added
    * Included Synth Plugins, many other products -1 (Logic was already 10)
* Bitwig
    * Included Effects Plugins +1 - New EQ and Saturator Added
    * MIDI FX +1 - Arp updates, Selector Modes
    * MIDI Tools +2 - Selector Modes
    * Modularity, all other products -1 (Bitwig was already 10) - Grid additions in 3.1 and 3.2.
* Live
    * Customer Support +6  (I've had multiple fantastic experiences with Ableton lately.)
* Waveform
    * Manual -2 - Waveform 11 released with _no updated manual_
    * Community Support -2 - 3 poor experiences when asking questions with my anonymous account in 2020.
    * Bug Reporting +1 - New crash/bug reporting tool.
    * Changelogs -1 - No major version changelogs.
* Bias (Larger numbers indicate less bias, positive numbers indicate potential unavoidable bias)
    * Preference - Waveform +5, Pro Tools +1, FLStudio +4, Live +10
        * Waveform 11 disappointing
        * Pro Tools moving slowly
        * FLStudio's frustrating Event Editor 
        * Live unrecoverably corrupted _two projects_ **and all backups!** (No other files affected on the system)
    * Connections - Waveform +3, Mixbus -1
        * Haven't spoken with Waveform team in a while.
        * Continue to have great discussions with members of Mixbus/Ardour team on various levels.
    * Frustration - REAPER +7, Studio One +40, Live +20 
        * REAPER 6 not working properly on my system despite the bug report being seen. 
        * S1 and Live should have been rated as extremely frustrating for me.
    * Community Interactions - REAPER + 5, Digital Performer -4, Studio One +2, Bitwig +2, Waveform +4
        * REAPER community has been more coarse than usual. 3/4 interactions on my anonymous account have been poor.
        * DP's Motunation has been chiller and more helpful in 2020.
        * Studio One's forums continue to be disappointing and fanboyish.
        * Bitwig's Discord server is run poorly. Strange rules that are enforced without thought. Very annoying.
        * Waveform's forums have been less useful and more harsh recently.

[![Sharpening Station](/assets/Sharpening/Thumbnails/station.jpg)](/assets/Sharpening/station.jpg)

Yep, I've been gone for about 1 month. I was working hard on a big post about... something which I'll write about later. In the meantime, since I do not have running water in the shop I made a little wall-hanging sharpening station. It's already quite dirty from use, and it works fantastic!

The whole thing is made of white pine 2"x4", 18mm birch plywood and the following parts:

* [1/2" female pipe thread to 1/2" barb](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Orbit-1-2-in-MNPT-x-1-2-in-Barb-Elbow-94359/206638395). Note the shape, the low-profile is very important. Big thanks to my wife for finding this piece! It was a pain in the ass to figure out how to get this put together and locate that specific part until she stepped in.

* [3/4" OD x 1/2" ID vinyl hose](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-4-in-O-D-x-1-2-in-I-D-x-10-ft-PVC-Clear-Vinyl-Tube-769299/207144355)

* [Submersible fountain pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013JPXNLA/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Note that the tubing and 1/2" adapter that you purchase must be compatible with the pump you choose. The pump that I purchased is a bit too powerful, but oh well!

* [Loc-Line Coolant Hose](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R9OFGS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). _DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND BUY OFF BRAND_. I made this mistake. Loc-line is superior!

How you build the basin and cabinet is up to you. I have it finished in 5 coats of water-based polyurethane, waxed then sealed with 100% silicone sealant. The basin is totally water tight.

How it works is simple. The pump pumps water from a bucket up to some vinyl pipe that's hidden in a channel behind the cabinet. The basin has vinyl tubing going back to the bucket. The pump is placed on the side of the bucket to minimize sediment pickup, and I will be adding a filter for the drain hose.

I used a footswitch (barely seen in the lower right) to activate the pump, and there's [LED strip lighting](http://www.inspiredled.com) (I pulled a piece so you can see it) under the shelf for lighting.

If someone needs the plans, I can put it together in sketchup. I do think that if you're capable of building it, you should be capable of designing something that works for your situation though!

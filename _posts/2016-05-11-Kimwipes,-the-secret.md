I've been ill for about a week now, but here's a quickie.

[Kimwipes](http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Clark-Kimtech-Kimwipes-Delicate-Disposable/dp/B00RORBXA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462975144&sr=8-1&keywords=kimwipes) are my favorite workshop thing now. Applying dye, shellac, wipeon finishes, cleaning glue and more.

No lint, absorbent and relatively cheap. They are small, but they last a long time. Buy a pack and see how useful they can be in your shop.

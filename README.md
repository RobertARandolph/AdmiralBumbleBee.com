# What is this?

This is the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-based [AdmiralBumbleBee.com](https://www.admiralbumblebee.com) website.

No Media. [See how to acquire the media assets](#media)

# How do I use it?

* [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `bundle jekyll serve --livereload`
* Go to [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to enjoy the [media-less](#media) website.


# How do I request a post/topic?

You may create an [issue](https://github.com/admiralbumblebee/AdmiralBumbleBee.com/issues) with your request. This will allow discussion, status updates and references to existing or finished articles.

# There's a problem, and I don't want to fix it.

That's cool. I dislike the pervasive "It's open source, fix it and submit a PR" mentality which expects consumers to become developers.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/admiralbumblebee/AdmiralBumbleBee.com/issues) and me or someone else will evaluate and take care of it as necessary.

# How do I write a post?

I use a script in the root called `create`. Use it as follows:

`./create Article Title Here category`, where category is the.... category.

# Where do I discuss it?

[Discord](https://discord.gg/34cFzVn) or [File an Issue](https://github.com/admiralbumblebee/AdmiralBumbleBee.com/issues).

# What's the License?

[CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)

If you wish to contribute non-code content then a separate contributor agreement is necessary. This will be provided privately.

# Being a Good Citizen

If you wish to contribute then I ask the following from you:

* Optimize all images - I use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac)
* Code changes - Provide a clear reason why you are proposing a change, the benefits of the change _and_ the potential downsides to the change. Nothing is perfect, and all PRs without pros **and** cons will be rejected!
* Article Contributions - I will be providing a style-guide for article contributions in the future.

# Media

Media assets are large-ish.

My current plan is to distribute media assets for contributors via [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com). It takes me time to setup proper access controls for each user, and I'll need to work out how I want to broadcast changes.

Given that each new user will likely take me 15-45minutes to setup, there is a one-time $15 fee to acquire the site's media assets. Please contact me (audioilabs@gmail.com) if you are interested.

Media assets are also licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

# This README sucks!

Yeah, I know. It's a work in progress. I've spent most of my time preparing the backend so this would be possible.

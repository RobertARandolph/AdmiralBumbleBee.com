It's time for another health update! The [last major update]({% post_url 2019-09-06-more-health %}) was about 1.5 years ago. I've since had more tests, further decline and plenty of excellent improvements in how to deal with it.


I will discuss the issues that I face in my daily life. I will be covering medications that I've tried and their effects. I'll be covering lifestyle changes that've helped. I've discuss things that have had a negative effect on my state.

If you are finding this article and are suffering from similar symptoms, please see your doctor. LISTEN to your doctor.

If you're under a doctor's care and are desperately looking for things that help you, please remember that this is _my_ experience. The causes is currently unknown for my current health state, but the effects of the disease are readily testable. My unknown cause may differ from yours. My body is not yours. What works for me, may not work for you.

These are my experiences, and my _experiences_ alone.

Listen to your medical health professionals.

# Progressive Neuropathy

I've had 3 positive tests for:

* [Small Fiber Neuropathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_fiber_peripheral_neuropathy) - Skin punch biopsy, severe disease in tested areas
* [Autonomic Neuropathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_neuropathy) - QSART, mild disease indicated. [Tilt-table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_table_test) positive without [isoprenaline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprenaline).
* Large Fiber Neuropathy (no good links online) - NCS/EMG, 50% loss in amplitude, 15%-25% reduction in conduction velocity.

3 Years ago I had NCS/EMG which was not indicative of large fiber neuropathy, a few weeks ago it was indicative of moderate/severe disease depending on the specific nerve.

Autonomic tests have also indicated progressive disease.

## Cause

I've been tested for nearly everything other the sun.

* Heavy metals
* Autoimmune
* Diabetes/Insulin Resistence
* A host of genetic disorders
* Vitamin deficiencies
* Cancer-related causes
* Vasculitic causes
* Endocrine causes (thyroid is fine, I've undergone the fully battery of tests)

All tests have come back negative thusfar.

## Symptoms

I've [written about symptoms before]({% post_url 2019-09-06-more-health %}), and those have mostly remain unchanged or become more severe.

This is a list of what I experience, not necessarily all of the potential symptoms.

* Autonomic Neuropathy
  * General Hypotension - 85/50 on average
  * [Orthostatic Hypotension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension)
  * Postprandial hypotension
  * [Bradycardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia) - Resting HR in the upper 40s.
  * [Bradypnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradypnea) - ~10 breaths per minute
  * [Gastroparesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroparesis)
* Small Fiber Neuropathy
  * Vestibular Neuritis - Sudden **intense** bouts of vertigo. Feels like a giant grabbed me and threw me across the room, but I never hit the wall.
  * [Burning Mouth Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_mouth_syndrome)
  * [Dysesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysesthesia)
     * [Paresthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia)
     * Sensation of wetness, usually on hands or arms
     * Fleeting, _intense_ burning pain
  * [IBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome)-like symptoms.
  * [Allodynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allodynia) - Specifically cold things feel painful rather than cold.
* Large Fiber Neuropathy
  * [Propioceptive dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception)
  * [Sensory Ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_ataxia)
  * [Muscle Twitching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciculation) - Often intense, looks like there's [graboids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremors_(1990_film)) running around under my skin.
  * [Foot Drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_drop) - recently led to a bad sprain which I've been recovering from for almost 4 months.
  * [Reduced Sensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoesthesia)
  * Weakness, primarily right side

## Impact

* I currently, and carefully, walk with a cane. It has been strongly suggested that I switch to a walker.
* I have had frequent falls. 1-5 a month.
* I will soon be wearing hinged AFO braces.
I currently can play drums for approximately 10 minutes before my hands become numb and I develop tremors.
* My feet 'stutter'. When I attempt to press a pedal there is sometimes a short lag before my foot moves.
I can play guitar or electric bass for about 20 minutes before my fingers become numb. Primarily on my plucking hand.
Typing is difficult. I often miskey, place my hands incorrectly or do not press keys hard enough to actuate the switch.
* I can type for approximately 10-20 minutes before my fingers have lost all sensation of pressure.
* I drop things frequently. I drop something that I believe I have firm hold of between 5-10 times a day.


## Mitigations

These are a list of things that I've tried that have not worked, and those that have yet worked.

### Diet

**SUCCESSFUL**

* Eliminating [Allium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium) - I've learned that foods that increase digestive motility trigger symptoms. The most common of these are alliums. Garlic and onions are the most common. Avoiding alliums is more difficult than you might imagine, onion and garlic are in more things than you might imagine, and eliminating them leads to some fairly bland experiences.
  * [Asafoetida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafoetida) is an alternative that I have not yet used.

**NOT YET SUCCESSFUL**

* Vegetarianism - No noticeable benefits. I am still currently vegetarian however.
* 

### Pharmaceutical

**SUCCESSFUL**

Prescription:

* [Lyrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin) - Reduces pain somewhat, helps a lot with vestibular issues.
  * [Neurontin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin) - I switch between these two medications. It seems that one will lose effectiveness and switching to the other provides a renewed relief of symptoms.
* [Sectral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acebutolol) - Manages orthostatic hypotension well.
* [Synthroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine) (Brand name only) - Generic causes stomach issues and headaches. Has worked well for managing hypothyroidism.
* [Emgality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galcanezumab) - Reduced frequency of migraines and [Cluster Headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache)
* [Nurtec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimegepant) - The only migraine abortive that has worked consistently for me
* [Maxalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizatriptan) - Provides mild migraine relief.

OTC:

* [Acetyl L-Carnitine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnitine) - I cycled through this twice, and it has a significant effect the LFN related symptoms.

**FAILED**

Prescription:

* [Elavil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline) - Pronounced sleepiness. Mild pain relief.
* [Cymbalta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duloxetine) - No relief. Moderate increase in sweating.
* [Savella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnacipran) - Fervent sweating.
* [Ultram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol) - No pain relief, increased compulsive behaviours. Abused this medication, withdrawal was hell.
* [Tylenol 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine/paracetamol) - No benefit, anxiety.
* [Tegretol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine) - No benefit, drowsiness.

OTC:

* [CoQ10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10) - No benefit.
* [Alpha Lipoic Acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid) - No observed benefit.
* [PQQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrroloquinoline_quinone) - Increase in paresthesia. I tried on/off twice and it was not a subtle effect.

### Lifestyle

* Sit/Stand Desk - Recommended by Dr, paradoxically has been a great benefit. Standing while working for even a few minutes at a time reduces pain in hands. Changes in posture seem to reduce severity of muscle twitches, even in muscles that aren't involved in the posture change.
* Calligraphy - I've taken up calligraphy to help practice and retain fine motor control in my hands. It has been quite effective.
* Note taking - I have switched my note taking from typing in [Orgmode](https://orgmode.org) to physically writing in a [notebook](https://www.jetpens.com/Maruman-Mnemosyne-N195A-Special-Memo-Notebook-A5-7-mm-Rule/pd/4585) with one of my favorite [pens](https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-Diamond-580-Smoke-Rose-Gold-Fountain-Pen-Medium-Nib/pd/29652) or [pencils](https://www.jetpens.com/Rotring-600-Lead-Holder-Drop-System-2-mm-Silver-Body/pd/8046). I retain use of my hands for much longer taking notes this way.
  * It has taken conscious practice handwriting, around 30-60 minutes a day, to develop and maintain habits that do not lead to increased tension or loss of sensation.
* [Resistance band training](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012ZWS9DA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Almost any exercise leads to muscle twitching and weakness. I've found that resistance bands offer me the most workout time for the least post-workout symptoms. High reps, low resistance, slow movements.
* [Improving lighting](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us) - I've increased the amount of light in the house, and made it possible to turn on lights before I reach my destination. Fewer falls as I can see where I'm going and be conscious of my movements. Lowering lights, and specifically using green lights, helps with migraines.
* [Write clojure](https://clojure.org) or [other lisps](https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/) only - I'm a sucker for experimenting writing apps with various esoteric, weird, old or hyped programming languages. I write less, but more reusable code, with Clojure and [clojure dialects](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) than anything else. I do miss spending hours fiddling with toy logic languages or writing forth on small AVR boards, but I gotta get stuff done.
  * Yes, I'm biased. No, your language isn't inferior (unless it's Rust or Haskell).
* 

#### Instruments

* Stiffer strings - When I began to notice loss of sensation and coordination in my hands, my first thought was to switch to lower tension strings. Wrong choice. Lower tension strings mean less feedback, more movement and require more coordination to play in tune. I switched to higher tension strings and it increased my playing times and decreased the associated symptoms.
  * Higher tension strings require less movement for the same volume, provide more tactile feedback, bend less (play in tune despite pulling/pressing too much) and respond better to unintentional 'flailing'-like movements.
* [BlueChip Picks](https://bluechippick.net) - These picks are simultaneously ultra-smooth gliding across the string, and easy to grip in the hand. I frequently dropped picks and have tried everything I can find. It seems that the primary issue is that the friction of rougher surfaced picks tends to 'grab' the pick out of my hand. I suspect that the reduction in vibration from the smooth and countoured surface allows me to play longer before numbness in my fingers settles in.
  * Yes, these are expensive. No, I don't think they are for everyone. They're not magic, but they do have qualities that I've not found in any other pick: slick on the strings, grippable in the fingers.

## Workarounds

There are some things that I can't really "fix", so I've developed some habits or changed my environment to help deal with certain issues.

* Grip cups with my pinky underneath - When I grip a cup I often let the cup sit on my extended pinky so that I have an extra level of sensation if my grip loosens.
* 

# Cluster Headaches

I've had moderate to severe Migraines with aura, and more often [silent migraines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acephalgic_migraine) since I was 14. If I was writing this post in 2017, I would lament how annoying migraines are. They _are_ bothersome and sometimes they can be crippling. Migraines **suck**.

In 2018 I had my first [cluster headache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache), or "Suicide Headache". Then I had another one. Then another one. Then another one. 

Before experiencing it, I'd been aware of the condition. I'd read medical texts, studies, blogs, etc... about migraines and frequently found discussions of cluster headaches. The stories were inconceivable. They are frequently described as one of the most painful things a human can experience. 

I've watched and read tales of people who'd lived through catastrophic, grave and traumatic situations. These same people experience cluster headaches and described the headache as ineffably more agonizing than their prior traumatic experiences. I chalked these tales up to some sort of self-validation or gaming a disability system or hamming it up for the cameras or... whatever.

I was completely wrong, and at this point I am going to become the person that I don't expect you to believe.

## The first one

My first cluster headache was while driving over the [Gandy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandy_Bridge). I felt a strange sensation run up the back up my neck, through my brain and into my eye. The sensation bloomed around my eye socket from a dull pain, as if someone was pressing their elbow into my eye, then to a warm burn, then a _searing__ burn. The burning and pressure intensified rapidly. I felt a sensation as if the bridge was swinging and increasingly as if my vehicle was being thrown about by gusty winds. Vertigo.

I can't say that my sense of time in that moment is accurate. It felt like the entire sequence took less than a minute. I pulled over on the bridge as fast as I could and immediately began vomiting. Time simply vanished. I do not recall having a sense of where I was or what I was doing. In restrospect, I'm terrified that I couldn't even think of calling emergency services.

I do not know how long it lasted. As it subsided, I remember finding some eye drops that I keep in my bag because I couldn't see well. I looked in the mirror and saw that I clearly had been crying. My left eye was drooping and I couldn't fully open it. (This happens when I get "normal" migraines too!?).

I drove home, somehow, and I don't remember doing so. I cleaned up at home, then had a second wave of vertigo and a fleeting, burning pain behind my eye. More vomiting. I cleaned myself up again.

My mother came over (unexpectedly, as mothers do) and noticed my drooping left eye. I explained what happened and she insisted on taking me to the hospital, to which I foolishly did not go. I make a rushed appointment with a (new) neurologist.

I don't think that I can explain what it's like in a way that will make the reader empathize. The initial shooting pain I think is conceivable by most people. Maybe mild vertigo is something that you recall at some point. The pain that makes you tear up no matter how hard you try to hold it back perhaps?

The headache itself, at its apex, consumes me. It is pure pain with waves of relent that only grant you enough consciousness to recognize the pain.

Perhaps it's a trite analogy, but that short moment after stubbing your toe when the world ceases to exists except for the realization of pain. That transient moment at the _very_ inception of that experience. The apogee of the initial moment. Extended it to 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour. Magnify it by whatever multiplier that you can dream up. Shove it in your head.

That's the start of a cluster headache, before it gets bad.

### Pain Scale

Everyone has been asked "On a scale of 1 to 10 how much does it hurt?"

I've broken quite a few bones. The most painful I rated at an 8. It **hurt**, but with some sort of bravado I would lower the number a bit, and a bit of intellectual honesty would make me recognize "there's surely _worse_ anyway". I had a tooth drilled without local anesthetic. I would have rated that at a 9, bordering on a 10. Early in the progression of the neuropathic disease was sciatic pain. I rated that a 10 on multiple occasions. Sciatic pain is _super_ not cool, dude.

I've heard of traumas which are greater than anything I've experienced or seen which I believe would make me halve those numbers in relation.

Since my first cluster headache, let alone the next few dozen, everything else is less than a 1. It's inconceivable for anything else to compare. 

I don't bring this up to reinforce the pain level of these headaches, but because of how strange it is to me that I struggle with that question now. I didn't realize how subjective a 'pain scale' is, and how much it relies on prior experience.

## Cause

As far as I'm aware, the cause is unknown. I have read anecdotes galore of people with autonomic diseases who received their agonizing gifts sometime after their autonomic diagnosis. Given that I expressed my first symptoms of autonomic neuropathy 7 years prior, it appears to be a reasonable assumption.

My cluster headaches have always happened in the early summer. "Normal" migraines in the early spring.

I have not identified any triggers.

## Symptoms

Cluster headache symptoms vary. Here's my experience:

* Initially - shooting pain up back of neck or head, into eyeball. This is consistent.
* Intense pressure behind left eye.
* A warmth behind the eyeball that progresses to an intense burning, then to an uncharacterizable pain.
* Tears.
* Vertigo - the sensation that the floor or my surroundings are being moved around me, often violently.
* Ringing in both ears.

## Impact

The impact is acute. The headaches last at most 45 minutes for me.

After an episode, I feel exhausted. My depth perception is usually poor (I assume because my left eye is half/fully shut for hours after).

I have some sort of guilt that builds. I tend to force myself to engage some productive activity soon as I can.

## Mitigations

None.

### Diet

None.

### Pharmaceutical

* [Emgality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galcanezumab) - Did not work great for migraines. Excellent reduction in Cluster Headache frequency.
* [Aimovig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erenumab) - Only 2 doses (months) in. Undetermined

### Lifestyle

Because of some symptoms of [neuropathy](#progressive-neuropathy), I've built a habit of knowing where my nearest safe places are: a ledge, a handrail, a chair.

After my first embarrassing cluster headache in public I started to keep constant track of how to quickly deal with that situation should it arise.

* Where is the bathroom in this building?
* How far am I from the front door?
* Is there a small corner I could quickly get to and sit?

I think about these things in every place I go. I've become less shy about exploring familiar or frequent places so I can exit routes or a safe place to handle my issue.

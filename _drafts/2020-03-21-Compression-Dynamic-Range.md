I hear it all the time, "The primary thing compression does is reduce dynamic range". **IT DOES NOT** (except when it does).

I'll be walking you through some of the basics of dynamic processing (not [data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression)), and providing you with a comprehensive answer as to how (upward _or_ downward) compression does not reduce dynamic range as its primary mode of action.

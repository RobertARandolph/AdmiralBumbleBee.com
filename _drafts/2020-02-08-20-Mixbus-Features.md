With Mixbus 6 arriving on the scene, I decided I wanted to highlight some features that [Mixbus](https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus.html) has that I wish every DAW had.

This is in stark contrast [to my previous article about Ableton Live]({% post_url 2020-02-01-20-things-I-hate-about %}). I originally wrote a "10 things about Mixbus" article in late December, but I decided to "wait until after [NAMM](https://www.namm.org)". The Live article was an extension of thought of _this original_ article.

Hop on through for the fluff.

# Disclaimers

Let's start with the disclaimers:

* I beta test for Harrison.
* I acquired my copies of Mixbus 5 and 6 without cost.
* I speak to multiple employees of Harrison in both a professional and friendly context with frequency.
* I have a big soft spot for [Ardour](https://ardour.org) both because of its goals and its functionality. Mixbus is built upon Ardour.

I've attempted to provide an objective list of features that you can evaluate. I won't act like I'm unbiased. I am biased. I hope that this is made clear enough that you can filter it out if you want.

# Introduction

Here we go with another list! This article...

* is about _any_ features in Mixbus, not just Mixbus 6.
  * unless I note that it's new in Mixbus 6.
* will mark features available in Ardour.
* is **NOT** claiming that these features are not available elsewhere.
  * unless I note otherwise.
* is **NOT** going to mention flaws of Mixbus, similar to how [the live article]({% post_url 2020-02-01-20-things-I-hate-about %}) didn't mention some of the awesome things about Live.

I've been using Mixbus _almost_ exclusively for the last 70 days or so and I'm enjoying it quite a bit (as long as I don't expect to touch MIDI...), so I've built up quite the enthusiasm.

I use Logic for a major project every week, and I use Digital Performer for another project. Switching back to them has left me longing for some of these Mixbus features more than I would have thought otherwise.

# The List
##  1 CPU Profile
##  2 Plugin Analysis
##  3 Latency Compensation
##  4 Calibrate Audio

##  5 Region Position Overlay
##  6 Analyze Exported Audio
##  7 Multiple Export Formats

##  8 
##  9 Meter Bridge
## 10 Channel Strip

Let me start this off on the wrong foot: I don't particularly like Mixbus's channel strip. [I've covered this in the past]({% post_url 2017-09-18-Mixbus-32c-The-Mixer %}#eq), so it shouldn't be a surprise.

That said, I wish every product out there had a high quality built in channel strip with an opinionated:

* EQ - at least 2 bells, 2 shelves/passes.
* Compressor
* Gate
* Long-throw fader.

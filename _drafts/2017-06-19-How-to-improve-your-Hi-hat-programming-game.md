# Introduction

One of the most common complaints about modern music producers is that their hi-hat programming sounds dull, lacks complexity or that they simply don't like what they do. This series of blog posts is here to help.

I've broken this topic down into stages.

* Physical Reality - Part 1 covers what hi-hats are and how they are played. Even the most modern electronic genres of music that use hi-hats still are standing on the tradition of 100 years of hi-hats (and stacked cymbals) on drum kits. The designers of classic drum machines were either trying to outright emulate or were at least inspired by the history of music up to that point.

    Understanding what a hi-hat is and how it's played will also give the reader the pre-requisite knowledge to apply convincing modulations to both emulated hi-hat playing and electronic hi-hat parts.

* Mixing and Synthesizing Hi-Hats - Part 2 covers some basic starting points for synthesizing electronic hi-hats, mixing hi-hats, correcting common issues with hi-hats and some invaluable tools for working with hi-hats.

* Programming Hi-Hats - Part 3 takes the pre-requisite knowledge from parts 1&2 and discusses the application of performance emulation, modulation and various tricks that will greatly enhance your hi-hat parts.

# What is a Hi-hat?

A hi-hat in the physical world is simply 2 cymbals stacked with their concavities opposing each other. When the convexity of one cymbal is touching the concavity of another, it's called a "stack".

## Parts of the cymbals

Hi-hats, like most cymbals, have their own anatomy. The image above labels the following parts:

* Bell
* Bow
* Edge

Despite a hi-hat being 2 cymbals, there's no rule that they must be the same. Usually the bottom cymbal is heavier and thicker, and often the top will have a slightly more pronounced bow and bell.

Along with the variation between the cymbals, each hi-hat cymbal may have a number of additions: holes, no bell, rivets, extra-thin, hammering, exaggerated tooling marks and more.

## Hi-hat stand

Modern hi-hats are generally placed on a special stand with a number of parts that allow for a variety of cymbal positions. Not all hi-hats are on a hi-hat stand. For instance on my drum kit, I have a set of permanently closed hats. I can vary their splashiness by changing the tension of the securing nut, but there's no dynamic movement of the cymbals.

Above there is a drawing of a hi-hat stand, and these are the parts and their descriptions:

# What sounds does a Hi-hat make?

The hi-hat owes its versatility as an instrument to the hi-hat stand, but performers can eek out a bit extra versatility through performance techniques.

Let's discuss some of the common sounds that a physical hi-hat can make.

## Foot

Perhaps the simplest method of playing a hi-hat is pressing down on the foot pedal. This yields a sound similar to a tip-strike closed hi-hat with an audible air-blast.

When the cymbals contact, the performer can vary the sound of the hats by adjusting the pressure holding the cymbals together. Low pressure can make for a longer decay sound with less air-puff, and high pressure gives a shorter decay with a slight upwards pitch modulation.

## Foot Splash

Foot splash is a technique where the performer presses the foot pedal quickly and releases instantly. It's similar to a foot version of the [Gladstone Technique](#gladstone).

Foot splashes on the hi-hat sound similar to a stick-hit open hi-hat splash.

## Bell

Most classic drum machines emulate the sound of the hi-hat bell being struck. The bell has more harmonically correlated sound, less noise, less attack and a longer decay. The classic open-hat 'Ding' sound is basically a hi-hat bell hit with the shoulder of the stick.

The bell of the hi-hat can make a number of sounds depending on how open the hats are and which part of the stick strikes it. The following are true for a fully-open hi-hat.

* Butt - Using the butt of the stick ([as with traditional grip rotation](#traditional-grip)) causes the most enharmonic content, the highest velocity and a distinct attack.
* Shoulder - The shoulder of the stick striking the bell is similarly loud, but with a less sharp attack and a slight high-frequency roll off.
* Tip - When the tip of the stick strikes the hi-hat bell there is a reduction in enharmonic content, a sharp but proportionally quiet attack, and less mid-range frequency content.

If the hi-hat is half closed then there is a slight noise burst after the initial attack and the overall decay is much shorter.

When the hi-hat is fully closed and the bell is struck there is very short decay and the upper and lower content of the hat bell sound is attenuated.

## Edge

Striking the edge of the hi-hat produces the most exciting and complex sound. The primary reason for the complexity of the sound is the extra leverage that the stick has relative to the hat's pivot point on the stand.

# How do you play a Hi-hat?

Discuss era, genres, application across dynamics and moving around the kit.

mention interplay of techniques, reliance on position of drum/hat, change in technique per passage etc..

## Foot Technique

The [Foot Splash](#foot-splash) discussed earlier is normally performed by striking the hi-hat pedal with the heel of the foot. The heel strike allows for a faster release of the pressure and readies the ball of the foot for quickly stepping down to close the hi-hat.

## Moeller technique

slow motion vid

The Moeller technique was named after, but not invented by, [Stanford Moeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_A._Moeller). The method is known mostly through the evangelization of [Jim Chapin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chapin) students of his like [Dom Famularo](http://domfamularo.com).

Also known as the 'Moeller Method', this technique is one of many that allows the drummer to generate multiple strikes from a single stroke motion. Commonly 2 to 3 strikes per stroke, but there are drummers that have been able to generate up to 6 strikes per stroke!

Moeller technqiue is a method of using both the downstroke and upstroke of the stick to generate strikes. The motion starts largely in the shoulder and travels down through the fingers in a whipping motion. The hand relaxes after the initial strike, then during the upstroke a second strike is generated using wrist flexion.

Due to the fact that the Moeller technique originals in the larger upper arm muscles it is most used for slower and/or harder drum playing. Moeller with 2-3 strikes per stroke can be used to play very quickly, however the initial stroke almost always has higher velocity than the subsequent strokes. Each subsequent stroke also strikes the drum/cymbal closer to the drummer than the strike before, which creates another layer of audible difference between strikes.

The Moeller technique is probably the most commonly used performance technique on hi-hats in most genres of music. Its usage is what gives that timeless 


## Open-Close

slow motion vid

The Open-close (or 'Push/Pull) technique is a multi-strike-per-stroke technique similar to the Moeller. The difference is that it relies almost entirely on finger control rather than wrist and arm-movement for the rebound strokes.

Open-close has 2 simple strokes:

* Open - The drum is thrown at the drum head from a normal 90° starting position with the hand closed around the stick. The stick is pinched on a fulcrum between the first joint of the index finger and the thumb, while the other fingers open to allow the stick to move freely. The stick strikes the drum and returns to the full 90° position with the hand being almost completely open rather than wrapped around the stick.

* Close - The close stroke begins at the end of the open stroke. With the stick placed at the same fulcrum and the open fingers resting lightly on the end of the stick, the hand is closed. The combination of the fixed fulcrum and closing hands causes a second strike to occur. Immediately after (or slightly before!) the strike occurs, the wrist moves to follow the rebound of the stick and return to the open stroke starting position.

The open-close technique is not restricted to a single return stroke. The close stroke can be subdivided into up to 3 rebound control stages to allow for a total of 4 total strikes for a single wrist action.

The open-close technique uniquely allows a drummer high-stroke efficiency without sacrificing consistency. Variable accents are easily achieved since the stick can be returned to any position at the top of each stroke. Open-close also uniquely doesn't rely as heavily on rebound as other techniques, and with practice can even be played efficiently on a pillow. The trade-off is that this technique takes a considerable amount of practice to become competent in, and from my research has a higher incidence of injury without proper instruction.

[Gordy Knudtson's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GKMusic54) has a number of fantastic videos on developing and using the open-close technique. 

There is a variation of the open-close technique called a 'Gravity Roll' where the rim of a drum is used for a fulcrum. As the butt of the stick is moved up and down, 2 quick strikes are created. The Gravity roll technique is very easy to learn and is a frequently used technique for 1 handed rolls and blastbeats.

## Gladstone

slow motion vid

What is often called the 'Gladstone technique' is usually a misnomer. Despite being named after [Billy Gladstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Gladstone), the technique is usually conflated with [G.L. Stone's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lawrence_Stone) freestroke technique. A number of Billy Gladstone's students teach what is basically the Free Stroke technique with finger motion. The Stone and Gladstone techniques have been amalgamated through generations of students intermixing techniques. In this section we will discuss the Free Stroke or Gladstone technique as it has evolved to the current day.

The crux of the Free Stroke technique is that the hand exerts minimal influence on the stick through the motion. Ideally the stick is thrown (or dropped) at the drum/cymbal, then as the rebound occurs the wrist follows the upward motion to return back to the desired stroke position.

The Free Stroke consists primarily of 3 positions with 2 strokes. The 3 positions are: 

* Full - Stick starts in approximately an 80• angle relative to the drum head. Used for harder strikes and warmup.
* Half - Stick starts in approximately an 45• angle relative to the drum head. Used for medium strikes and accents during fast passages.
* Low - Stick starts in approximately an 5• angle relative to the drum head. Used for light strokes and very fast passages. The low stroke varies in velocity and can sometimes be as loud as a full stroke, despite minimal movement relative to the full stroke.

Each position evokes 2 strokes: Upstroke and Downstroke. The downstroke consists of the stage where the stick is moving towards the head, and the upstroke is the rebound stage.

* The downstroke is not really a complete stroke. The optimal downstroke in this technique is an initial force to the stick follow by relaxation of the hand. The wrist follows the stick as it moves towards the head and exerts minimal influence during the movement.

* The upstroke is not an stroke at all. The upstroke consists of the natural rebound of the stick coming off the drum and the hand following the movement with minimal or no influence.

While the Free Stroke does not offer the same mechanical efficiency per stroke as the Moeller technique, it does offer significantly greater control of accents. All Free Stroke and Gladstone teachers that I'm familiar with spend a great deal of time with their students stressing reducing tension in each stroke, and thusly proper usage of this technique reduces fatigue and chance of injury.

A vocal proponent of the modern Gladstone technique is [Bill Meligari](http://www.tigerbill.com/tigerbillbio.htm). He has an excellent breakdown of the modern Gladstone technique with [this 3-part series](http://www.tigerbill.com/drumlessons/buildingmonsterchopsgladstone_part1.htm).

## Traditional Left-hand

slow motion vid

Traditional grip is a grip where the stick lies in the web of the thumb and is primarily controlled by the first, second and sometimes third fingers. Traditional grip has a great deal of sub-techniques such as its own moeller technique, variations of gladstone, a number of 1-handed roll techniques. For the sake of simplification I will only cover a light overview of the traditional grip.

Traditional grip was developed as a response to the marching snare drum hanging off to the right of the drummer. As the drum kit developed, the more capable traditional snare drummers were the first to give laudable performances. Owing to the influx of traditional drummers, the drum kit was setup with the snare drum leaning to mimic the side-hanging-marching-snare.

In the early 20th century pop music became more accessible and various styles of drum-kit-centric dance music like jazz developed. The traditional grip was almost exclusively used and various traditional grip techniques became rhythmic staples of jazz and jazz-inspired music. Despite some drummers adopting matched grip (where both hands hold the stick similarly), there have always been hold-outs that [champion the superiority of traditional grip(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz4_culboZs)] such as the late [Buddy Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Rich)

The main takeaway regarding traditional grip, in the context of this series, is that it causes the hands to have different capabilities and often a wide variance of sound between them. When working with jazz music it's particularly important to recognize this differences, and the capabilities that this grip offers, so that you can create more convincing drum parts.

Here's an incomplete breakdown of some of the considerations with traditional grip:

* Bounce - traditional grip largely relies on bounce to generate strokes. Moeller technique and a variation of pure finger technique are popular with the traditional gripping hand. It's fairly uncommon to hear fast and consistent waling on a single drum or cymbal with the traditional grip hand. There will usually be an accent followed by rebound strokes. More advanced practitioners can 'pull out' accents in the middle of a multi-strike stroke, however it's still a consideration that multiple fast and high-velocity strikes are rarely played in sequence.
* Stick shoulder usage - The angle that the stick is held in traditional grip makes it far easier to hit the hi-hat with the shoulder or body of the stick. To use the tip of the stick on the hi-hat, the arm generally must be lifted higher than necessary with matched grip. Playing the hi-hat with the traditionally gripped stick is relatively rare, but neither impossible nor unusual.
* Butt usage - The drummer will often pronate their wrist when playing the hi-hat with the traditionally gripped stick so that they can play the hi-hat with the but of the stick. The butt of the drum stick has a larger radius, more mass and a more bulbous profile. When a hi-hat is played with the butt, the pitch is lowered slightly, it's higher than average velocity, the high-end is damped slightly and if opened there's a more pronounced splash.

## Pure finger technique

slow motion vid

Pure finger technique is executed with the french grip. The french (or timpani) grip is when the drummer supinates his wrist so that the top of the thumb is facing upward and is in-line with the drum stick.

With pure finger technique, the drum stick rests between the pad of the index figer and thumb. The stick motion is generated and followed by the remaining fingers. After a strike is generated by closing the remaining fingers, they open to allow a full rebound, catch the stick at the appropriate height and repeat the motion.

Pure finger technique is incorporated in to the [Gladstone](#gladstone-technique), but I feel that it deserves special mention since many drummers rely on pure finger technique without incorporation of gladstone when playing fast passages. Pure finger technique is also relied upon when a very consistent sound is required, since the arm and wrist do not move at all. The drum stick strikes the drum at nearly the same place with equivalent velocity each time.

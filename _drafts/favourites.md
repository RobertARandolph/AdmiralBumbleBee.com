---

I get a lot of e-mails and messages asking me "What's your favourite...". I don't think anyone should really care, but my wife has been pushing me to put together a page about it for years now. I have capitulated.

So now in the features section you can go to the "[Favourites](/favourites.html)" page

# Favourites

I average a couple dozen "What's your favourite..." or "What do you use for..." a week. Sometimes I get a few dozen _per day_. This ranges from studio equipment, to health products, to woodworking, to electronics equipment, to clothing (seriously, I don't understand.) and more.

My wife has been urging me to do this _and_ to use affiliate links. Affiliate links being links that take you to a site with a special code and I get some kickback for it. **I won't be doing this**.

Everything that can be reasonably linked is linked with bare links. I get nothing from you looking at the items. If you want to support the site than you can [subscribe on Patreon](http://patreon.com/admiralbumblebee) or [donate directly](https://paypal.me/admiralbumblebee).

I will be trying to keep the list up to date if/when these things changes.

[I would also like if you read the header on the favourites page](/favourites.html).

# What is this

This is **NOT** an overview of everything I use. It's just the stuff that I enjoy using (or is necessary, but the least terrible option). I could write entire articles on why I like many of these things over their competitors, so I will only be adding small notes if anything on this page.

I will try to keep this up to date if and when my tastes change. If you have questions about anything listed, or suggestions, then **please leave a comment**.

There are **NO AFFILIATE LINKS**. Every link is clean and safe to click. I get absolutely nothing for you clicking around. Your browsing habits are not tracked by me in any way.

# Computing

I currently use an [Apple iMac Pro](https://www.apple.com/imac-pro/) and a [2018 macbook pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP776?locale=en_US). I quite like both computers.

My favourite computer I've ever owned, and still use, is my 11" 2018 iPad Pro with Apple Pencil. I bring it everywhere. I use it for nearly everything.

## OS

[I DESPISE WINDOWS]({% post_url 2018-12-15-Why-I-hate-Windows %}).

I like macOS, and [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org).

# Graphics

* [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - mac and ios
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) - mac and ios.
* [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) - mac only.
* [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/)
* [Hype](https://tumult.com/hype/) - I use hype for all animations currently. I quite like this software.
* [Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - Let me be clear: I don't like Resolve. It's just the least bad video editing software that I know of.
* [Panasonic G9](https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/lumix-interchangeable-lens-ilc-cameras/DC-G9KBODY.html) - Not my only camera, but definitely my favourite.

# Productivity

* [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) - I use omnifocus to organize nearly every aspect of my life. It is central to my ability to function as a human.
* [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) - I use omnigraffle to organize my ideas before I execute them.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - I've been happily using VS Code for nearly 2 months now. Zero qualms [unlike last time]({% post_url 2018-10-06-Editor-Musings %}#vs-code). Main Extensions I use are as follows:
    * [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) - I use Vim bindings no matter what editor I'm in. I'm a fairly advanced vim user and heavily rely on good vim emulation.
    * [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) - Calva is pretty nice. Wish it didn't rely on [nrepl](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.6.0/index.html), but... whatever.
    * [Gitlens](https://gitlens.amod.io) - Oh. My. Goodness. Gitlens is the coolest. It'd be an entire post in itself to explain why I love this so much. Gitlens alone is nearly a singular killer reason to try VSCode.
    * [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
    * [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
    * [Bracket Pair Colourizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) - Yeah, I'm one of _those_ people. I've been using some form of this for over 25 years. I've always used the same colours and it's hardcoded into my brain for reading code now. I don't recommend it, but I can't work without it.
    * A bunch of java crap that I'm not going to link.

# Language Learning

* [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com) - Vocabulary building
* [Drops](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drops-language-learning/id939540371) - iOS Only. Vocabulary building.
* [Anki](https://www.ankisrs.net)

# General Music Software

* [Capo](https://supermegaultragroovy.com/products/capo/)
* [Sonarworks Reference](https://www.sonarworks.com/reference) - It's not magic, but it does help enough to be worth the tradeoffs.
* [Metronome Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pro-metronome-tempo-beat-subdivision-polyrhythm/id477960671) - iOS Only. Fantastic Metronome program.

# Music Production

## Microphones

* [Shure SM7B](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b) - Fits my voice brilliantly.
* [M201TG](https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/m-201-tg.html) - My favorite guitar amp mic.
* [Royer R-121](https://royerlabs.com/r-121/) - If the M201TG doesn't do it, the R-121 will.

I've never owned a condenser mic that I would call "My favourite". However, [the warbler series](http://www.3uaudio.com/chanpin.asp?dh=1) offers what I would consider the absolute best _value_ on the market. Not the best mics, but the best for your money by a significant margin.

## Cabling

* [Mogami Platinum Silent Guitar Cabling](http://www.mogamicable.com/category/instrument/electric_guitar/) - I don't believe that cabling makes a difference for _most_ studio applications, but _guitar cables do matter_. These also have a super cool switch that breaks the connection when removing the cable. Zero hum when unplugged.
* [GLS Audio](https://www.glsaudio.com) - Excellent cabling for the price. Sufficient quality in most cases to be worth buying over making my own cabling from bulk.

## Audio Interface

* [Universal Audio x8p](https://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/apollo-x8p.html) - I have a stack of these. Worth every penny and more.

## Control Surfaces

* [Softube Console 1](https://www.softube.com/console1) - I like the workflow and it integrates nicely with the UA Interfaces.
* [Pro Tools | Control](https://www.avid.com/products/pro-tools-control) - iOS. Works with any euphonix compatible DAW. Better than most DAW company's native product.

# Computer Music Production

## DAW

* [Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform) - Not the DAW that I _use_ the most. I think that the Waveform team is doing some of the coolest stuff and improving their software faster than any other company.
* [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com) - Similar to Waveform. Fast moving. They have a vision. It's unique.

Reminder: What I _use_ and what's my _favourite_ aren't the same things. My primary DAW isn't necessarily my favourite, and I may use it because of necessary functionality rather than a desire to enjoy the product.

## Channel Strips

I prefer to reach for a channel strip before anything else.

* [SSL 400 E](https://www.uaudio.com/uad-plugins/channel-strips/ssl-4000-e-series-channel-strip-collection.html) - I learned on a 4K, and this is one of the best emulations out there that I've used.
* [API Vision](https://www.uaudio.com/uad-plugins/channel-strips/api-vision-channel-strip.html)
* [bx_onsole N](https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/bx_console_n.html) - Guitars and Voice. Lovely.

## EQ

* [apQualizr](http://www.apulsoft.ch/apqualizr2/) - If I can't channel strip it, apQualizr is what I always reach for [I've changed my preferences since an older post]({% post_url 2017-12-05-30-days-without-Fabfilter-products-pt2 %})

## Compression

* [Klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.php) - [Mjuc](https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/MJUC/MJUC.php) and [dc8c](https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/DC8C/DC8C.php) are amazing.
* [Voxengo Marquis Compressor](https://www.voxengo.com/product/marquiscomp/) - Unassuming, but versatile and excellent sounding.
* [TrackComp](https://dmgaudio.com/products_trackcomp.php) - Quite possibly my favourite compressor. Incredible emulations and quick to get what you want out of it.
* [Multiplicity](https://dmgaudio.com/products_multiplicity.php) - **GOOD STUFF**.

### Limiting

* [Limitless](https://dmgaudio.com/products_limitless.php) - The best. End of story.

# Why

The math here is simple! 

* A single drumstick is about 0.05 board feet.
* A single board foot of maple is around $6.00usd
* A single drumstick thereby costs $0.30

Compare that to the $7-12 cost in store, plus the immense flexibility you have in wood selection, sizing, finish and more...

It's a no brainer!

Well, except the equipment. Here's the bare minimum that I'd suggest

* [A cheap lathe](https://www.harborfreight.com/5-speed-bench-top-wood-lathe-65345.html) - I purchased one of these for drum stick turning for about $130.
* [Veritas Dowel Maker](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/dowel-and-tenon-cutters/42331-veritas-dowel-maker) - About $250
* A lathe tool - This can vary.
    * Make your own - [I wrote an article on how to make your own great tool for cheap]({% post_url 2016-04-26-Turning-Tools-on-the-Cheap %}) - $50 or so.
    * [Lathe Chisels](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/sets/100714-economy-turning-tools-set-and-tool-roll) - $100-$400

# What I'm using

## Wood

I'm using [Sugar Maple](https://www.wood-database.com/hard-maple/). [Various forms of Hickory](https://www.wood-database.com/?s=hickory) are the most common, with [Shiragashi Oak](https://www.wood-database.com/white-oak/) being used occasionally.

It's important that the material have excellent impact resistance, low [Elastic Modulus](https://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/modulus-of-elasticity/) with a [High Modulus of Rupture](https://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/modulus-of-rupture/) and be relatively non-porous.

If you use a species that's too stiff, the lack of shock absorption will ruin your hands quick. If it breaks too easy then... well, duh. If it's too porous then it will degrade quickly.

Weight is generally not a concern, but it is a component that pivots based on other factors. You won't get a heavy wood with a low Elastic Modulus, and a light wood with a high Modulus of rupture won't happen.

So don't hop over to the home store thinking that you can grab some local Pine or Oak or Walnut dowels, chuck it in your drill, and make some usable drumsticks.

Per contra, you can saunter over to your local lumberyard and purchase excellent hickory, white oak, hard maple and ash without a hitch. Finding pre-made dowels may be more difficult, but for an extra charge the will usually rip a board to the size you need.


## Dowel Maker

I use the [Veritas Dowel Maker](http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=42331&cat=1,180,42288&ap=1), which is an expensive kit for most drummers I suppose. It will cost you about $300 for the supplies that you need to make common sized dowels for drum stick making.

When you consider that you're probably paying up to (or exceeding) $15usd for drum sticks, and that the raw materials (wood) to craft your own cost <$0.50 per _pair_ then the value proposition is upscaled into a new territory of tasty.

You also gain the freedom of experimenting with different woods, shapes (shoulders, necks, grips), tips, asymmetry and anything you can think of.

## Lathe

You probably want a lathe. [A cheap one will be totally fine](https://www.harborfreight.com/5-speed-bench-top-wood-lathe-65345.html) and you can get them on sale/couponed/second-hand for $150 or less.

You can [easily make your own tools]({% post_url 2016-04-26-Turning-Tools-on-the-Cheap %}) on the cheap. If you're new to this then I **STRONGLY** suggest starting out carbide-insert based turning tools.

Traditional turning tools allow you to achieve better results more quickly and with a higher level of precision for _some_ operations, but they also require sharpening equipment (more $$) and acquisition of a particular skillset (more time). I will be using traditional turning tools, specifically a [spindle gouge](https://www.woodturnerscatalog.com/p/130/3481/henry-taylor-M2-HSS-Spindle-Gouge), [skew chisel](https://www.woodturnerscatalog.com/p/130/3170/henry-taylor-M2-HSS-Rounded-Edge-Skew-Chisel) and a [scraper](https://www.woodturnerscatalog.com/p/129/5536/henry-taylor-M2-HSS-Bowl-Scraper).

I've made probably a hundred pairs of sticks (probably more) with the [tools that I made]({% post_url 2016-04-26-Turning-Tools-on-the-Cheap %}). Don't think you can't get by cheap.

An alternative here is to just throw your stick in a drill and sand it to shape, or make your own mini-lathe. I do not recommend it. Long spindles require more support, and you'll be lucky if you can fit the stick in your chuck anyway. It's a mildly dangerous operation with a 18" spindle spinning in your hand with a piece of dermal destroying sandpaper vying for the grippy-attention of the stick. Not that I've uh... done anything _that_ stupid. Not me... nope. Never.

## Surface Finish

Surface finish is likely the most important aspect of the construction of sticks. Sticks that are too smooth will fly out of your hands, and sticks that are too rough will leave callouses.

It's not as simple as picking the correct grit of sandpaper and givin' 'er a rub. When you sand it and how you sand it matter _even more_.

Let's look at the image above. If we have the stick on the lathe, with the stick turning as expected, if touch sandpaper to the stick it will be abrading perpendicular to the grain. We've taken the natural undulations in the wood and cut across them. Our smooth ridges have now turned into not-so-smooth peaks. The surface of the stick is essentially a landscape of regular pyramids.

The grit of the sandpaper can be reduced in size to make this egyptian terrain less prickly, but we're forced to double our efforts. Finding the balance between an abrasive surface and a grippy surface is difficult.

There's yet another factor when sanding perpendicular to the grain. We're essentially pre-scoring the wood in the axis where it will receive the most force. Imagine looking at where your sticks hit the edges of your cymbals. Now consider putting some knife marks right there. Does that help the longevity of the sticks? That's exactly what you're doing with sandpaper in the above case. Even though the 'knife marks' of the sandpaper are much smaller, they're also more numerous.

What's the alternative? Sanding perpendicular to the grain. The natural convolutions of the wood's structure are instead subdivided. The depth is reduced by the removal of wood, and the variance in shape is normalized.

Naturally, a critical thinker may leap at the dining table and shout, "Alas! Now the surface anomalies are parallel to the trajectory of my stick's escape from my mortal claws!" Yes, they are. You're creating a [churro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churro) on a micro-scale.

The 'slipperiness' of this configuration is also its saving grace. The parallelized structure can be finished to a rougher (larger) grit without causing significant abrasive action on your skin. In my testing, 220 grit (lower is rougher) parallel is equivalent in feel to about 600 grit perpendicular. Yet the 600 grit is _both_ easier to let fly, and harsher on the hands when you keep it in tow.

There's a tertiary consideration, and if you know anything about my habits in the studio maybe you can guess: repairability. Cross-grain abrasion is not easily refreshed without creating an awful _looking_ mess and an unpleasant _feeling_ mess of cross-grain and cross abrading. It's difficult to put a worn stick back on the lathe so you'll be forced to try to twist the stick inside some folded sandpaper. Inevitably your scratches will cross the scratches you've made previously and now you have 3 axes of torture.

With parallel abrasion, you can accurately and easily refresh the grip of the stick after the pores and grain have been filled with oil and jetisoned skin. Fold up some sandpaper and pull the stick through it a few times. Done. Easy. Good as new.

## Topcoat

Wood is fine. Coated wood is better.

A well-selected coating will increase the impact resistance, abrasion resistance and change the modulus of rupture. It works very similarly to those fancy coatings on glass: small bits do break, but the jacket of protection holds it in and stops complete rupture.

The variety of options is tremendous. A discussion of coatings, their tradeoffs and application _just for drum sticks_ could feel a book. I'm not qualified to write that book, and I'm not even going to try to write an article on it.

I will tell you that I've tried a variety of coatings and I've settled on one: Shellac.

[Shellac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac) is the secretion (**NOT** the excrement or "poop") of the lac bug, which is usually dissolved in ethanol to varying degrees of proportion.

Here's why I've settled on Shellac:

* Repairability - I repair my sticks. Yet another topic for yet another article, but shellac important to this process. Shellac readily dissolves in alcohols, and it's applied while dissolved in alcohol. You can apply subsequent coats to existing 'worn' shellac without issue and you can clean off previous coats easily if desired. Eventually your stick will wear and expose uncoated wood. Shellac is the easiest to recoat with.
* Control - I [purchase shellac in flake form](https://www.shellac.net/dewaxed_shellac.html) and then mix it myself to the concentration that I want. I can vary the strength, weight, drying time, mix variants etc...
* Flexibility - Shellac is one of the more flexible 'hard' coatings. If you play with some thick buttons of it, it will easily crack as if it's hard and brittle. If you take a thin sheet (such as what you'd put on your stick), it's surprisingly pliable for something so brittle. Most other common coatings with short drying times are more brittle.
* Drying time - Shellac dries in 15 minutes or less. If you put on a thin coat, it's a matter of how long it takes for the alcohol to evaporate.
* Application time - You can apply your next coat of shellac... whenever. You can keep applying and applying and applying for an hour without stopping, and you will build up a coat. It'll go faster if you wait 5-15 minutes between coats though ;) Compared to the 2-4 hours between coats (and the dreaded, wait until cured if you exceed 4 hours), shellac is amazing.
* Universal Mistake Fixer - If you've ever finished wood then there's a good chance that you've ended up with hazing, swirlies, fisheyes, brushmarks... tldr; frustration. Shellac not only rarely has these problems but _it fixes them_. Almost any commercially available finish can be soundly applied upon shellac. Shellac will cover up any hidden oils, silicone, over-porosity and other bug-a-boos. You're (likely) more lavish topcoat can be applied upon the shellac with no qualms.
* Cleanup - Spill some shellac on the floor? Your hand? Your prized 1952 telecaster? (oops). Just wipe it off with some alcohol and go about your life. Nice.

So you see: Shellac > All.

# Setup

## Dowel Maker

The Dowel maker instructs you to make blanks of a specific size to fit in the initial bushing. Do that.

That's all of the setup.

## Dowel Maker Tips

The Dowel Maker (DM from here on out) instructions are clear. They're also wrong. I'm certain they're wrong and I'm flumoxxed as to how they think it's correct.

## Lathe

[That cheap lathe I linked earlier](https://www.harborfreight.com/5-speed-bench-top-wood-lathe-65345.html), that's exactly the lathe I use for drum sticks. It sits on my benchtop and is always available for small projects.

If you decide to go this route, then you will want a [simple 3 jaw check](https://www.grizzly.com/products/Grizzly-3-4-Jaw-Chuck-1-x-8-TPI/H7605) and a [Live Center](https://www.harborfreight.com/mt2-live-center-38573.html).

Due to the lathe's bed size, it's not possible to turn a 16.5" drum stick at the chuck end. That presents a problem. The live center does not provide as much support as the chuck. The chuck has a solid grip on the stick, and the live center is just poking at end-grain.

Care must be taken when turning a thin spindle, like a drum stick, on the tail end of the lathe. It's not a big deal, but you may experience some chattering that will won't feel great, and it can impact the surface finish of the stick.

If you have a longer lathe, or lathe extension then work on the chuck side and just cutoff the leftover bit (that was inside the chuck) when you're done.

If you're able to find a "Live Cone Center" that will work for 1/4"-1/2" (6mm-12mm), then please use that. I have not found a live cone center sufficient for stabilizing small spindles.

A device called a [Spindle Steady Rest](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/woodriver-spindle-steady-rest) _could_ be an option, but I've yet to find a working style. Here's the issues:

* Size - A spindle rest requires something to turn with the spindle. We want to turn spindles down to around 1/4" (6mm). That means that our wheels at larges can be:
    * What we're finding is called [Descartes' Theorem or Soddy's Circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_theorem). We want to find the 3 largest exterior circles that are tangent to each other and tangent to an interior circle. Our three circles will have identical radii.
        * Formula: r4 = r1r2r3/(r2r3 + r1(r2 + r3) + 2sqrt(r1r2r3(r1 + r2 + r3))))
        * Formula Equilateral, as all 3 radii are identical: r4 = x^3/(x^2 + x(2x) + (2sqrt(x^3 (3x)))) 
        * Data for [c-like consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)): 0.25 = x^3/(x^2 + x * (2x) + (2 * sqrt(x^3 * 3x))) = 1.61603
    * The largest possible wheels will have a radius of 1.61603" to be used with a 1/4" stick.
    * Those are some surprisingly small wheels, about 3" (7.6cm), and in my experience it's necessary to create long rollers to avoid overly [burnishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnishing_(metal)) the surface or simply indenting it.
* Rubber wheels leave marks if the work slips. Metal Bearings burnish the work.
* Cost - The good ones get pretty expensive.

A potential solution you may think of is to offset some large wheels along the long axis of the spindle. Unfortunately that makes it practically impossible to get sufficient support without lightly warping the spindle.

Now that I've written all this, I've realized that I could try a large 2 rubber roller setup where the wheels counteract only the lateral pressure put forth by the tool. A third wheel isn't needed for a small spindle.

Dear reader, thanks for [ducking this one out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) with me.

# Stick Shape

Stick tips have two axes. The tangent of both axes influence how much wood touches the drum or cymbal. More wood touching = less high frequency content, less rebound.

The shape of the tip can affect the directionality of the rebound, the tangent of contact for angle of the stick upon contact and the durability of the tip.

An exploration of stick tip types could fill a book. It's sufficient to explore them yourself as long as you consider the tangent of the tip at contact angle while looking along the stick, and while looking down the stick.

I prefer what's called an "Acorn tip". It allows me to vary the amount of wood contact by changing the stick angle. The shape of the tip naturally causes less wood contact with a higher angle (such as hitting cymbals), thereby producing a brighter sound with a sharper transient. Lower and negative angles produce more wood contact, lessening attack slightly and mildly damping high frequencies: excellent for drums.

With turned sticks, one axis will always be circular, so the consideration is the radius of the circle. The other axis can vary infinitely and even a shape with a small area can have a large contact area, and a large shape can have a small attack area.

Refer to the drawing above to visually explore the concepts.

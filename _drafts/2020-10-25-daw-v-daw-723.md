# Results - Studio One version 5.0.2.60299

Tests are at 48,000hz sampling rate, using a Komplete Audio 6. I chose to use a common USB interface to emulate the most likely common use. This hardware and sample rate will be used in every test.

All tests are in macOS 10.15.7. If there is _significant_ interest in testing DAWs in Windows then I will. (i.e. You pay for my time to suffer through Windows.)

I'm using Sample One to load the [test impulse](/assets/DVD72/impulse.wav). All effects are turned off in Sample One. I'll be using a native sampler in all DAWs if/when possible to give the benefit of the doubt to the native implementation of virtual instruments. The behaviour of a third party instruments might not be consistent across APIs (vst/au/aax) or have hidden behaviours. I think giving the benefit of the doubt to native implementations is the most generous.

I'll be testing buffer sizes of 128, 512 and 2048 utilizing the dropout protection settings of Minimum, Medium and Maximum. There might be a threshold for change in behaviour that lies between these settings (1024 buffer at high protection, perhaps) that I will not be chasing.

Each test will have 3 iterations that will be presented as a 3 frame video, with the data in csv format supplied.

Each frame in the video will have information about the latency between the _end_ of the MIDI signal and start of the impulse. The information is supplied textually and measurable yourself in the csv. If there is variance between tests of the same settings, the test results **do not imply the actual jitter range**. It's likely that the extent of the jitter (in practice) exceeds the min and max values of the test.

There are a total of 27 tests.

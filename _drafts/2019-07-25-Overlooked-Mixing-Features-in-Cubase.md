description: Some overlooked features for Mixing in Cubase
---

Cubase has some really neat features for when you're mixing your project. Some of them are available in other DAWS, but I know of nothing that matches Cubase in the complete workflow.

So give me a few minutes of your time as I ~~count down~~ demonstrate the features that I think get too little recognition for how useful they are.

# Introduction

There's a lot more cool features than what I'm discussing here. This article is about the features where I think the hype:leverage ratio is out of whack.

I'm structuring the article and video based on the things where I feel that the usefulness significantly exceeds the amount of discussion I've seen regarding the feature.

Here's some cool features that I've covered before:

* [Snapshots]({% post_url 2018-11-14-Cubase-10-update %}#mixconsole-snapshots)
* [Waveform Meters]({% post_url 2016-06-26-CubaSeductive %}#waveform-meters)
* [Racks]({% post_url 2016-06-26-CubaSeductive %}#pre-rack)
* [Sizing]({% post_url 2016-06-26-CubaSeductive %}#size-configuration)
* [Control Room]({% post_url 2016-07-11-CubaSerenity %}#control-room)

# Mixconsoles - Plural

Cubase has a mixer, and a mixer... and a mixer.

_AND_... a mixer.

There's 4 available MixConsoles in Cubase, and they all can be setup differently. What can be different?

* [Track visibility](#Visibility)
  * [Zone Setup](#Zones)
* Racks
* Channel size
* Meter settings
* Left/Right mixer zone setup
* Scroll position

You could have a mixer setup for just your string section, one for only your master track, and one for that banging [trap beat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music_(EDM)).

Maybe you want a mixer setup for [only metering](#meter-bridge), or you want quick access to the channel strip?

There's so many possibilities! If you're reading and you have larger projects then I'm sure your eyes are wide right now, but even people with smaller projects will be able to appreciate how easy it is to access things by simply opening your _customized MixConsole_ for that task.

I believe this is the most under-rated feature in Cubase, and from what I've seen it's also one of the most underutilized.

No more thinking in terms of process, "How do I get to X" or "What do I press to show...". Multiple MixConsoles allow you to think in terms of context, "I wish to see _this thing_". **BANG** Open the correct MixConsole and the context is presented to you.

Cubase allows you to have your mixer channels span multiple windows. Each of the MixConsole windows can be linked to another. The primary window is the master, and the secondary/tertiary MixConsole windows are overflow.

So if there's channels that can't be displayed on your primary, then they are displayed on the secondary. If the secondary overflows then the tertiary starts to display channels.

Really cool.

# Meter Bridge

Metering is important. Cubase [already has excellent metering]({% post_url 2016-06-26-CubaSeductive %}#meter-section), and some of those features extend to each meter.

Sometimes you just want some big meters to see what's happening. **Enter the Meter Bridge.**

The Meter Bridge is a set of big meters. That's it, and that's pretty useful.

# Q-Link

The concept of selecting some channels and having them automatically group basic controls isn't unusual. Many DAWs can do that.

Q-Link is something that many DAWs can _not_ do. In fact, I don't know of any that can replicate its behaviour. **Q-Link links _everything_**.

Fader/pan, channel rack parameters, I/O and _ever plugin parameters_. That's right, if the same plugin is in the same slot, then you can change the same parameters in plugins across multiple tracks.

Adding/Removing plugins works as well. Maybe you have one of those fancy channel strip or console emulation plugins and you want it on every channel? Turn on Q-Link, Select the Channels you want, add the plugin to one channel. Now all channels have the plugin and you can even adjust parameters in the plugin and have them sync'd across tracks.

Q-Link can be turned on/off whenever you want so that you don't accidentally make grouped parameter changes when you are doing other actions on selected tracks. Q-Link is not hotkey mapped by default, so I have mine set to `option-q` (`alt-q`).

I don't know of any other product that offers something as comprehensive as Q-Link, nor allows you to change the grouped parameter behaviour with a single easily-accessible click.

Hey. My name is Robert Randolph.

Maybe [read this post about me first?]({% post_url 2018-06-09-Lets-talk-about-me-and-my-future %})

**This is what I do with my free time:**

* Develop software in...
	* C/asm for AVR and ARM microcontroller platforms
	* [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net) for desktop and web.
	* [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and Java for desktop.
	* ~~Haskell for fun.~~
        * I'm current playing with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) for fun now.
		* I've been adding cljs capability to my resum√© recently.

* Music...
	* Electric and Double bass
	* Percussion, mainly drum kit focusing on jazz and post-rock styles
	* Piano
	* Trombone
	* Trumpet
	* Electric Violin
	* [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) fiddling
	* VST programming
	* Instruction and teaching!
	
* Software tinkering
	* I just have a **really** big interest in DAWs, their workings and workflows.
		* I currently primarily use Cubase and Reaper.
	* I really love [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) and [Many products from ManyTricks Software](https://manytricks.com). Specifically [KeyMo](https://manytricks.com/keymo/), [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) and [Time Sink](https://manytricks.com/timesink/).
	* I design with [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/), [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/).
	* Videos are done with [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) and [Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) using a [Panasonic G9](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dc-g9) and various Logitech Webcams.
	* ~~I was a __die-hard__ [emacs user](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), but I tried to live without it for a month. It was successful and I continued using [Vim](http://www.vim.org) as I have for a long time, then I did a month without that and... now I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org).~~
	* ~~Nope. As of February 2018 I'm back to using emacs and [Evil Mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil). VS Code is awesome software, but the VIM layer is just not as good as I need. I also really miss things like [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper), [Key Chords](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord) and having relative line numbers in normal mode, and absolute line numbers in insert mode. It's built in to my consciousness.~~
	* Nope... using VSCode again. Vim bindings don't seem to suck as much anymore, [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) is pretty awesome. The 'out of the box' cross-language capabilities are just too good to ignore.

* Tutorials!
	* DAW tutorials
	* Mechanics and efficiency tutorials for music
	* Electronics repair

* Workshop
	* I have a pretty nice workshop where I build all sorts of things that you'll see here.
* Cook
	* I do a lot of the cooking in the house, and I quite enjoy it.

* [Freenode.net](https://freenode.net/) as AdmiralBumbleBee. I spend most of my time in #ardour, #lisp, #clojure and ##C
	* I'm usually on other servers like thinstack, quakenet, rizon, efnet and more.

  * [Motu Nation](http://www.motunation.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=56328) - Eh, I don't really use this much. There's 2 users that ruin the entire environment.
* ~~Yeah, that's it pretty much. I don't do the social online thing much.~~
  * Ok, I'm working on making $$ from this site, but I still refuse to put ads. So I'm trying to figure out this social media thing now:
      * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/admiralbumblebee/)
      * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/admiralbee)
      * [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/admiralbumblebee)
* E-mail - I use gmail. My [local-part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address) of the email is `audiolabs`.

**You won't find me at**

* github. (Actually I am [on github](https://github.com/admiralbumblebee). I just don't use it much)
  * I dislike the community aspect of development, and I also prefer to use [Mercurial](http://mercurial-scm.org). So I use [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) instead.

Hey. My name is Robert Randolph.

# Free Time

* Develop software in...
	* [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and Java for desktop.
	* C/asm for ~~PIC,~~ AVR and ARM microcontroller platforms
    * Javascript.
    * ~~Java~~
	* ~~[Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net) for desktop and web.~~
	* ~~Haskell for fun.~~
        * ~~I'm current playing with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) for fun now.~~

* Music...
	* Electric and Double bass
	* Percussion, mainly drum kit focusing on jazz and post-rock styles
	* Piano
	* Trombone
	* Trumpet
	* Electric Violin
	* [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) fiddling
	* VST programming
	* Instruction and teaching!
	
* Software tinkering
	* I just have a **really** big interest in DAWs, their workings and workflows.
		* I currently primarily use Cubase and Reaper.
	* I really love [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) and [Many products from ManyTricks Software](https://manytricks.com). Specifically [KeyMo](https://manytricks.com/keymo/), [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) and [Time Sink](https://manytricks.com/timesink/).
	* I design with [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/), [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/).
	* Videos are done with [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) and [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) using a [Panasonic G9](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dc-g9) and various Logitech Webcams.
    * I use [Talon](https://talonvoice.com) for most of my computing. [My talon setup is on github](https://github.com/admiralbumblebee/AdmiralBumbleBee_Talon), but it's always behind my local config.
	* ~~I was a __die-hard__ [emacs user](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), but I tried to live without it for a month. It was successful and I continued using [Vim](http://www.vim.org) as I have for a long time, then I did a month without that and... now I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org).~~
	* ~~Nope. As of February 2018 I'm back to using emacs and [Evil Mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil). VS Code is awesome software, but the VIM layer is just not as good as I need. I also really miss things like [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper), [Key Chords](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord) and having relative line numbers in normal mode, and absolute line numbers in insert mode. It's built in to my consciousness.~~
	* ~~Nope... using VSCode again. Vim bindings don't seem to suck as much anymore, [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) is pretty awesome. The 'out of the box' cross-language capabilities are just too good to ignore.~~
    * Nope. Emacs user. That's it, emacs for life. I'm done with it.
* Workshop
	* I have a pretty nice workshop where I build all sorts of things that you'll see here.
* Cook
	* I do a lot of the cooking in the house, and I quite enjoy it.
* Gardening
  * Our property is covered in greenery, and we grow food all year long.
  * I particularly enjoy plants that are dangerous in some manner. Toxic, skin irritants, stinging, etc...

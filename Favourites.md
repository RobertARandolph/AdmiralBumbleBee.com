# What is this

* This is **NOT** an overview of everything I use. It's just the stuff that I enjoy using (or is necessary, but the least terrible option).
    * Some of these (like [DAWS](#daws)) are not my "daily driver". Sometimes I use things that aren't my favourite because of necessary functionality, ease of use, accessibility or consumability (for items that are consumable or use consumables).

* I could write entire articles on why I like many of these things over their competitors, so I will only be adding small notes if anything on this page.

* I will try to keep this up to date if and when my tastes change. If you have questions about anything listed, or suggestions, then **please leave a comment**.

* There are **NO AFFILIATE LINKS**. No discount codes. I have not listed any products for companies that I've done paid work for (even if it's my favourite product). Every link is clean and safe to click. I get absolutely nothing for you clicking around. Your browsing habits are not tracked by me in any way.

* If I lost all of this, it'd be fine. It's ok to enjoy things.

# A Common Thread

There's one thing I generally like: creators that are opinionated. I like to experience someone's vision, to see how they see the world and experience their ideas of how to get things done.

If something is a wishy-washy mess of bleh, then I usually don't care.

I want to see enjoy a design, a vision, a concept.

Rarely do I want things that allow me to explore my own visions. I make stuff. My house is a series of workshops. I can program. I can work with metal. I can work with wood. I can work with electronics. I can work with clays and ceramics. I can draw. I'm not the _best_ at any of these things, but if I have a vision then I am confident that I can attempt to execute it myself.

I want to experience _design_.

# Computing

I currently use an [Apple iMac Pro](https://www.apple.com/imac-pro/) and a [2018 macbook pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP776?locale=en_US). I quite like both computers.

My favourite computer I've ever owned, and still use, is my 11" 2018 iPad Pro with Apple Pencil. I bring it everywhere. I use it for nearly everything.

## OS

[I DESPISE WINDOWS]({% post_url 2018-12-15-Why-I-hate-Windows %}).

I like macOS, and [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org).

# Graphics

* [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - mac and ios
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) - mac and ios.
* [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) - mac only.
* [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/)
* [Hype](https://tumult.com/hype/) - I use hype for all animations currently. I quite like this software.
* [Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - Let me be clear: I don't like Resolve. It's just the least bad video editing software that I know of.
* [Panasonic G9](https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/lumix-interchangeable-lens-ilc-cameras/DC-G9KBODY.html) - Not my only camera, but definitely my favourite.

# Productivity

* [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) - I use omnifocus to organize nearly every aspect of my life. It is central to my ability to function as a human.
* [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) - I use omnigraffle to organize my ideas before I execute them.
* **RETIRED**
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - I've been happily using VS Code for nearly 6 months now. Zero qualms [unlike last time]({% post_url 2018-10-06-Editor-Musings %}#vs-code). Main Extensions I use are as follows:
      * [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) - I use Vim bindings no matter what editor I'm in. I'm a fairly advanced vim user and heavily rely on good vim emulation.
* [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) - Calva is pretty nice. Wish it didn't rely on [nrepl](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.6.0/index.html), but... whatever.
        * [Gitlens](https://gitlens.amod.io) - Oh. My. Goodness. Gitlens is the coolest. It'd be an entire post in itself to explain why I love this so much. Gitlens alone is nearly a singular killer reason to try VSCode.
        * [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
        * [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
        * [Bracket Pair Colourizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) - Yeah, I'm one of _those_ people. I've been using some form of this for over 25 years. I've always used the same colours and it's hardcoded into my brain for reading code now. I don't recommend it, but I can't work without it.
        * A bunch of java crap that I'm not going to link.
* I love [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and I can't live without the following packages:
  * [Evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) - I prefer vim, Evil is better than vim.
  * [Ivy/Swiper/Counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) - I use this hundreds of times a day. If I ever develop dementia, I'm sure I'll forget my wife before I forget how to use it.
  * [Dired Plus](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredPlus) - The best file browser on ANY operating system.
  * [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
  * [Visual Regexp Steroids](https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp-steroids.el) - Python backend regex for Emacs. More sane syntax, and expressions as replacements.
  * [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org) - Spreadsheet, scheduling, timing, multi-language programming and more. I have 100s of org files on my system, most used weekly.
  * [Ace Windows](https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window) - Keyboard based window navigation. I can get to any window I want with my eyes closed using a set of static keys.
  * [Company Mode](https://company-mode.github.io) - My preferred completion engine.
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - I use Alfred for so much. I easily use it 100s of times a day. App Launching, App Switching, Math, Conversions, Clipboard Management, Itunes Control, General System Automation, Document Opening and more.

## Backup

* [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com)

## Hardware

* [Steel Series Sensei Ten](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/sensei-ten) - Recently switched to this over the 310. Preferred.
* [Filco Majestouch TKL](https://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=763) - Blue switches with 80g springs. No Dampers.

# Language Learning

Specifically I study Korean and Vietnamese.

* [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com) - Vocabulary building
* [Drops](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drops-language-learning/id939540371) - iOS Only. Vocabulary building.
* [Anki](https://www.ankisrs.net)

# General Music Software

* [Capo](https://supermegaultragroovy.com/products/capo/)
* [Sonarworks Reference](https://www.sonarworks.com/reference) - It's not magic, but it does help enough to be worth the tradeoffs.
* [Metronome Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pro-metronome-tempo-beat-subdivision-polyrhythm/id477960671) - iOS Only. Fantastic Metronome program.
* [Sonic Visualizer](https://sonicvisualiser.org) - Amazing **FREE** audio analysis tool.
* [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) - I use this **SO MUCH**. I love this program.
* [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) - Also used quite a bit.

# Music Production

## Microphones

* [Shure SM7B](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b) - Fits my voice brilliantly.
* [M201TG](https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/m-201-tg.html) - My favorite guitar amp mic.
* [Royer R-121](https://royerlabs.com/r-121/) - If the M201TG doesn't do it, the R-121 will.

I've never owned a condenser mic that I would call "My favourite". However, [the warbler series](http://www.3uaudio.com/chanpin.asp?dh=1) offers what I would consider the absolute best _value_ on the market. Not the best mics, but the best for your money by a significant margin.

## Cabling

* [Mogami Platinum Silent Guitar Cabling](http://www.mogamicable.com/category/instrument/electric_guitar/) - I don't believe that cabling makes a difference for _most_ studio applications, but _guitar cables do matter_. These also have a super cool switch that breaks the connection when removing the cable. Zero hum when unplugged.
* [GLS Audio](https://www.glsaudio.com) - Excellent cabling for the price. Sufficient quality in most cases to be worth buying over making my own cabling from bulk.

## Audio Interface

* [Universal Audio Apollo x8p](https://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/apollo-x8p.html) - I have a stack of these. Worth every penny and more.
* [Universal Audio Apollo Twin mkII Quad](https://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/apollo-twin-mkii.html)

## Control Surfaces

* [Softube Console 1](https://www.softube.com/console1) - I like the workflow and it integrates nicely with the UA Interfaces.
* [Pro Tools Control](https://www.avid.com/products/pro-tools-control) - iOS. Works with any euphonix compatible DAW. Better than most DAW company's native product.

## Speakers

* [Eve SC307](http://www.eve-audio.com/index.php?page=SC307)
* [Eve TS112](https://eve-audio.de/index.php?page=TS112)
* [Adam A7 Original](https://www.adam-audio.com/en/archived-products/a7/) - Note, I do not like the new A7x.

## Instruments

### Guitars

* 2007 Fender Custom Shop Jaguar bass - My absolute favourite instrument. If my house was going to be levelled and I could only grab one thing. This is it.
* MTD 534-24 Headless custom bass - My baby.
* Fender 1952 Time Machine NOS Telecaster.
* Suhr Classic S.

## Drums

* [Sonor SQ1](https://www.sonor.com/instruments/drums/sq1-series/sq1-series/) - 20/10/12/14 in Cruiser Blue.
* [Benny Greb Signature Snare](https://www.sonor.com/instruments/drums/snare-drums/signature-series/benny-greb-signature-snare-drum/    )
* 1965 Ludwig Steel Snare drum.
* [Puresound Custom Pro Snare Wires](http://www.puresoundpercussion.com/PSPProductDetails.Page?AxPageID=6211&mode=0&productid=9&ActiveID=4896&productname=Custom_Pro) - I don't use these on _every_ snare drum, but they're my favourite snare wires when appropriate.
* [Pearl Eliminator Demon Direct Drive P-3002D](https://pearldrum.com/products/hardware/drum-pedals/demon-direct-drive/#p-3002d) - My goodness, I love this pedal so much. It's helped me improve my performance capabilities as my physical capabilities have deteriorated.
* I make my own drumsticks and prefer them to store purchased products.

## Accessories

* [Rockslide Aged Nickel slide](https://www.therockslide.com/shop/aged-nickel-guitar-slide/)
* ~~[Nickel Silver Thumbpicks](https://www.jimdunlop.com/product/3040tls-7-10137-00964-6.do?sortby=ourPicksAscend&page=4&refType=&from=fn)~~
* ~~ [Dunlop John Petrucci Jazz III](https://www.jimdunlop.com/product/427pjp-7-10137-05837-8.do)~~
* [Zookies 30deg](https://www.jimdunlop.com/product/z9002m30-7-10137-00717-8.do) - I now play guitar and bass exclusively with a 30deg zookies pick that's been ground to a Jazz III-like tip. Much easier on my hands/fingers.
* [Dunlop Straplocks](https://www.jimdunlop.com/products/accessories/straplok) - I dislike any other strap locking system.

## Pedals

* [Keeley Time Machine Boost](http://www.robertkeeley.com/manuals/time_machine_boost.pdf) - Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. If I only had one pedal, this would be it.
* [Keeley Compressor Prod](https://robertkeeley.com/product/keeley-compressor-pro-namm-2015/) - The least intrusive compressor I've found for both guitar _and_ bass guitar.
* [Dual Utter Stutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXc1YhyajXM) - Custom feedback pedal. 1/1, just for me.
* [Darkglass Vintage Ultra](https://www.darkglass.com/creations/vintage-ultra-v2/)

# Computer Music Production

## DAW

* [Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform) - Not the DAW that I _use_ the most. I think that the Waveform team is doing some of the coolest stuff and improving their software faster than any other company.
* [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com) - Similar to Waveform. Fast moving. They have a vision. It's unique.

Reminder: What I _use_ and what's my _favourite_ aren't the same things. My primary DAW isn't necessarily my favourite, and I may use it because of necessary functionality rather than a desire to enjoy the product.

## Channel Strips

I prefer to reach for a channel strip before anything else.

* [SSL 4000 E](https://www.uaudio.com/uad-plugins/channel-strips/ssl-4000-e-series-channel-strip-collection.html) - I learned on a 4K, and this is one of the best emulations out there that I've used.
* [API Vision](https://www.uaudio.com/uad-plugins/channel-strips/api-vision-channel-strip.html)
* [bx_console N](https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/bx_console_n.html) - Guitars and Voice. Lovely.

## EQ

* [apQualizr](http://www.apulsoft.ch/apqualizr2/) - If I can't channel strip it, apQualizr is what I always reach for [I've changed my preferences since an older post]({% post_url 2017-12-05-30-days-without-Fabfilter-products-pt2 %})

## Compression

* [Klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.php) - [Mjuc](https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/MJUC/MJUC.php) and [dc8c](https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/DC8C/DC8C.php) are amazing.
* [Voxengo Marquis Compressor](https://www.voxengo.com/product/marquiscomp/) - Unassuming, but versatile and excellent sounding.
* [TrackComp](https://dmgaudio.com/products_trackcomp.php) - Quite possibly my favourite compressor. Incredible emulations and quick to get what you want out of it.
* [Multiplicity](https://dmgaudio.com/products_multiplicity.php) - **GOOD STUFF**.

### Limiting

* [Limitless](https://dmgaudio.com/products_limitless.php) - The best. End of story.
* [Elephant](https://www.voxengo.com/product/elephant/) - My "Grab and Go" for (I think?) 15+ years. It's always improving and staying on the cutting edge of Limiting capabilities.

## Transient Processing

* [Transgainer](https://www.voxengo.com/product/transgainer/)
* [Transreckon](https://www.eareckon.com/en/products/transreckon-transient-shaper.html)

## Reverb

* [Ocean Way Studios](https://www.uaudio.com/uad-plugins/reverbs/ocean-way-studios.html)
* [EAReverb](https://www.eareckon.com/en/products/eareverb2-reverb-plug-in.html)
* [Valhalla Delay](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/delay/valhalladelay/) - It's not a "reverb", but it has quickly become one of my favorite reverb tools.

## Delay

* [Late Replies](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_LateReplies/)

## Spatial

* [EARevolve](https://www.eareckon.com/en/products/earevolve-stereo-chorus-rotary-speaker-plugin.html)

## Synthesizers

* [Bazille](https://u-he.com/products/bazille/)
* [Pulsar Modular](https://www.pulsarmodular.com/products/) - I only trialed this. I did not purchase on principle, as the author did not respond to _any_ of my presales e-mails over the course of 4 months (Including two anonymized e-mails in case he was somehow ignoring me specifically).
* [The Legend](https://www.synapse-audio.com/thelegend.html) - _The Best_ emulation on the market.
* [Aalto](https://madronalabs.com/products/aalto)
* [MSoundFactory](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MSoundFactory) - I wouldn't _recommend_ MSF to anyone unless you enjoy a menu/window based workflow and endless deep diving into parameters. Something about MSF makes me forgive the sins of UI design and I love using it.

## Guitar Software

* No Amp Sims. - There's definitely 'my favourite amp' sim. But nothing that I'd rather play over a real amp, yet.
* [Redwirez Cabinets](https://www.redwirez.com)
* [Blue Cat Axiom](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_Axiom/) - Not as an amp sim specifically, but as a universal guitar tool.

## Samples

* [Berlin Orchestra Products](http://www.orchestraltools.com)
* [Superior Drummer 3](https://www.toontrack.com/product/superior-drummer-3/)

## Other

* [StandardClip](https://www.siraudiotools.com/StandardCLIP.php) - Clipping is _GOOD_, when done right. This is where you get it done right.
* [Voxengo Soniformer](https://www.voxengo.com/product/soniformer/) - I consider this my "secret weapon". It's a 32-band multiband compressor, but the way you interact with the controls is unique, intuitive and appropriate.

# Woodworking and Manly Stuff

## Electrically Powered Blades

* [Spectrum Supply KERFMaster](http://www.spectrumsupply.com/kerfmaster-2.aspx) - Fantastic for resawing. Nearly identical (if not OEM  ) to the [Woodslicer](https://www.highlandwoodworking.com/woodslicer-resaw-bandsaw-blades.aspx), which I also like.
* [Freud Circular Blades](https://www.freudtools.com/explore/saw-blades) - The cost, availability and selection make this my preferred product line over the otherwise excellent [Woodworker Then Kerf Line](https://www.forrestblades.com/woodworker-ii-thin-kerf/).

## Hand Tool Blades

* [PM-V11](http://www.pm-v11.com/Story.aspx) - I use PM-V11 based product wherever I can. Amazingly durable and easy to sharpen.
* Koyamaichi Chisels - Shirogami #2.
* [Knew Concepts Coping Saw](https://www.knewconcepts.com/Coping-saws.php)
* [Pfeil Carving Tools](https://pfeiltools.ch) - My wife purchased these for me initially. They're fantastic.

## Hand Tools

* [Veritas Low-Angle Jack Plane](http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/Page.aspx?p=49708&cat=1,41182,41186,49708) - I use this darn thing so much. I've nearly used up a 30° blade in least than 5 years.

## Marking and Measurement

* [Uni-ball Diamond Infused Lead](https://www.amazon.com/Uni-Ball-Diamond-Infused-Leads-0-7mm/dp/B003CPF5HS) - I thought it'd be a gimmick. It might be, but it works. No more breaking lead on rough grain, but I get to maintain consistent lines and sharpness with a mechanical pencil.
* [Kuru Toga Roulette Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Roulette-Model-Rotation-Mechanical-Pencil/dp/B00U6T8NX6/ref=sr_1_7?crid=E1K4SEM451LW&keywords=kuru+toga+mechanical+pencil&qid=1567870076&s=office-products&sprefix=kuru+t%2Coffice-products%2C159&sr=1-7) - Much better than the Pentel GraphGear series.
* Variety of vintage Mechanical Pencils - I collect vintage mechanical pencils. I have too many that I like to list.

## Other

* [My Shop Apron]({% post_url 2017-05-28-The-Apron %}) - Made by my wife for me. Works brilliantly.
* [Incra Miter 1000HD](https://www.incra.com/miter_gauges-miter1000hd.html) - Forget having a shop-made wooden miter sled. I prefer this miter gauge for precision work.
* [RabidModels Cyanoacrylate](https://www.ebay.com/str/rabidmodels) - Some of the best prices and value. I particularly like their "Flex" product.
* [Veritas Honing Guide](http://www.veritastools.com/Products/Page.aspx?p=144) - Some tools need precise bevels, and this is the best honing jig on the market. I've tried them all. I hone by hand while "working" and finish my day with a precise bevel grind.
* [GRR-Ripper](https://www.microjig.com/products/grr-ripper) - Two of these. Awesome. Easy to adjust to the work so that you can feel confident in the outcomes of the potential failures of a given operation. Better cut results through better work control as well.

## Knives

* [Opinel No.8](https://www.opinel-usa.com/collections/opinel-beech-wood-handle/products/no-8-opinel-stainless-steel-blade) - I have _many_ fancy pocket knives, but my Opinel No.8 goes with me everywhere.

# Kitchen and Food

* [Kitaoka Blue #2](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/bl2stkn.html) - I have a number of Kitaoko Blue #2 kitchen knives. High on my list of "Would grab in a fire".
* Chopsticks - I make my own chopsticks from exotic woods with rough tips. I eat most of my food with chopsticks, not for [weeb reasons](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=weeb) but because it's been easier for me since I started to have hand issues.
* [Wüstof Offset Spatula](https://www.wuesthof.com/germany/products/Product-details/spatula-4433) - You might think that $50 for a spatula is crazy, until you use one for a few years then try to go back to anything else.
* [Chefalarm](https://www.thermoworks.com/ChefAlarm) - Best on the market that I've found. Absolute essential kitchen tool. I prefer this over the Thermapen.
* [IR Thermometer](https://www.thermoworks.com/IR-Gun) - I also believe this to be essential, particularly if you like to cook on Cast Iron and Carbon Steel like I do.
* [Blue Breeze Vanilla Almond Milk](https://www.bluediamond.com/brand/almond-breeze/almondmilk/vanilla) - I'm allergic to dairy products, and Almonds are one of the few nuts that I'm not allergic to. For some reason I can't smell or taste almonds, so this just ends up being a pleasantly thick, slightly sweet vanilla drink.
* [Phở](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho) - I eat phở nearly every day for lunch. I make my own from scratch.
* [Earthgrown Veggie Patties](https://www.aldi.us/en/grocery-goods/quality-brands/earth-grown/) - Particularly the Kale ones. I eat these things bees eat sugar.

# Electronics

* [Hakko 936](https://www.hakkousa.com/products/soldering/936-esd-soldering-station/hakko-936-esd-soldering-station-6586.html)
* [Hakko FR-301 Desoldering Tool](http://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_fr301.html) - Until you have one, you can't understand how useful this darn thing is. I refused to by myself one because I though it was "too expensive". Got one for christmas and now I can't figure out how I lived without it.
* [Klein Solid and Stranded Wire Stripper/Cutter](https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/adjustable-wire-stripperscutters/katapult-solid-and-stranded-wire-strippercutter) - This thing _rocks_.

# Clothing

* [Darn Tough](https://darntough.com) - Lifetime warranty (I've had socks replaced for free around 10 times now), and quite comfortable.
    * (I'm supposed to wear compression stockings, but I love my darntough socks too much!)

# Books

I'm keeping this relatively short. Note: I don't like Fiction.

* [Not always so](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Always-So-Practicing-Spirit/dp/0060957549)
* [The Book of Five Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Five_Rings)

* [The Ashley Book of Knots](https://www.amazon.com/Ashley-Book-Knots-Clifford-W/dp/0385040253)

* [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X) - I don't agree with everything in the book, but was a catalyst for me to rethink some presumptions I had about human motives and common assumptions.
* [Roubo on Furniture](https://lostartpress.com/collections/roubo-translation/products/deluxe-roubo-on-furniture)
* [Woodworking in Estonia](https://lostartpress.com/collections/books/products/woodworking-in-estonia)
* [By Hand and Eye](https://lostartpress.com/collections/books/products/by-hand-eye-1)

* Squarepusher/Shobaleader One
* Vulfpeck
* The Main Squeeze
* Kamasi Washington

# Software Development

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org) - Clojure saved me from leaving the software development world entirely. I love working with it. I don't necessarily agree with every aspect of it, but I value that there is a clear thread of intention and architecture.
* [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) - I've been using Calva for nearly 3 months now. It's not the most advanced CLJ/CLJS environment, but it works simply. I've grown to prefer Calva + VSCode over the wasteland of Emacs' package ecosystem. All I need is a send to repl and some structural editing tools. Clojure makes the rest pretty simple.
* [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) and [nRepl](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.6.0/index.html) - I actually don't like Cider _or_ nRepl as software. In fact, I rather despise nRepl. What I love is the push to develop better tooling and the passion behind the projects. I monetarily support these projects even though I do not enjoy using them.
* [nim](https://nim-lang.org) - Rust is clearly trying to be a better C++. Nim is trying to be _a better language_. Nim is an interesting exploration into what a systems language can be if you stop trying to be C++. (and it has _proper_ lisp-like macros.)
    * I can't stand the indentation thing... but you can't get everything right I guess.
* [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net) - Big fan of ZSH. Used to prefer fish, but I was constantly dealing with bash-incompatibilities.
